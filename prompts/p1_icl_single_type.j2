You are a Solidity smart contract auditor. Your task is to analyze a given
solidity smart contract for {{ vulnerability_type }} vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Description
{{ vulnerability_description }}

## Examples
The following three contracts contain {{ vulnerability_type }} vulnerabilities.
Vulnerable lines are marked with `<{{ vulnerability_type | upper }}>...</{{ vulnerability_type | upper }}>` tags.

### Example 1
```solidity
{{ example1_code }}
```

### Example 2
```solidity
{{ example2_code }}
```

### Example 3
```solidity
{{ example3_code }}
```

---

## Task
Analyze this contract for **{{ vulnerability_type }}** vulnerabilities ONLY.
Do not report other vulnerability types - focus exclusively on {{ vulnerability_type }}.

```solidity
{{ contract_source }}
```

---

## Certainty Score
After your analysis, rate your confidence as a percentage (0-100%).

## Output Format
Return your analysis as a JSON object:

If vulnerability found:
```json
{
  "contract_name": "ContractName",
  "contains_vulnerability": "yes",
  "vulnerability_type": "{{ vulnerability_type }}",
  "vulnerability_location": {
    "lines": [line_numbers],
    "function": "function_name",
    "description": "Brief description of the vulnerable code pattern"
  },
  "certainty_score": 0-100
}
```

If no vulnerability found:
```json
{
  "contract_name": "ContractName",
  "contains_vulnerability": "no",
  "vulnerability_type": "{{ vulnerability_type }}",
  "vulnerability_location": null,
  "certainty_score": 0-100
}
```

Analyze the contract now and return ONLY the JSON response.
