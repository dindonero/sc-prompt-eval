You are a security auditor specializing in Solidity.

Task:
1) Audit the following Solidity contract for vulnerabilities.
2) Classify each vulnerability using DASP categories (e.g., reentrancy, access_control, arithmetic).
3) Return ONLY valid JSON that matches the schema below.
4) If no issues are found, return [].

Schema (informal):
- Array of objects with keys:
  category, title, severity, confidence, evidence{file, lines, function}, explanation, fix_suggestion

Contract:
```solidity
/*
 * @source: etherscan.io 
 * @author: -
 
 */

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract B {
    address public owner = msg.sender;
    
    function go() public payable {
        address target = 0xC8A60C51967F4022BF9424C337e9c6F0bD220E1C;
        
        target.call.value(msg.value)();
        owner.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
    
    function() public payable {
    }
}
