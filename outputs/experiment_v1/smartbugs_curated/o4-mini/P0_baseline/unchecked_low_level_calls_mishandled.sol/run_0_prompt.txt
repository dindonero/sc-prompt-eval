You are a security auditor specializing in Solidity.

Task:
1) Audit the following Solidity contract for vulnerabilities.
2) Classify each vulnerability using DASP categories (e.g., reentrancy, access_control, arithmetic).
3) Return ONLY valid JSON that matches the schema below.
4) If no issues are found, return [].

Schema (informal):
- Array of objects with keys:
  category, title, severity, confidence, evidence{file, lines, function}, explanation, fix_suggestion

Contract:
```solidity
/*
 * @source: https://github.com/seresistvanandras/EthBench/blob/master/Benchmark/Simple/mishandled.sol 
 * @author: -
 
 */

pragma solidity ^0.4.0;
contract SendBack {
    mapping (address => uint) userBalances;
    function withdrawBalance() {  
		uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];
		userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;
        
		msg.sender.send(amountToWithdraw);
	}
}
```
