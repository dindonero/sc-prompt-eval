You are a security auditor specializing in Solidity.

Task:
1) Audit the following Solidity contract for vulnerabilities.
2) Classify each vulnerability using DASP categories (e.g., reentrancy, access_control, arithmetic).
3) Return ONLY valid JSON that matches the schema below.
4) If no issues are found, return [].

Schema (informal):
- Array of objects with keys:
  category, title, severity, confidence, evidence{file, lines, function}, explanation, fix_suggestion

Contract:
```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract MyContract {

    address owner;

    function MyContract() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function sendTo(address receiver, uint amount) public {
        
        require(tx.origin == owner);
        receiver.transfer(amount);
    }

}
