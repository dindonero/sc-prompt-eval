You are a security auditor specializing in Solidity.

Task:
1) Audit the following Solidity contract for vulnerabilities.
2) Classify each vulnerability using DASP categories (e.g., reentrancy, access_control, arithmetic).
3) Return ONLY valid JSON that matches the schema below.
4) If no issues are found, return [].

Schema (informal):
- Array of objects with keys:
  category, title, severity, confidence, evidence{file, lines, function}, explanation, fix_suggestion

Contract:
```solidity
/*
 
 * @author: -
 
 */

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Proxy {

  address owner;

  constructor() public {
    owner = msg.sender;
  }

  function forward(address callee, bytes _data) public {
    
    require(callee.delegatecall(_data)); //Use delegatecall with caution and make sure to never call into untrusted contracts
  }

}

```
