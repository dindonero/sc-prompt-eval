You are a security auditor specializing in Solidity.

Task:
1) Audit the following Solidity contract for vulnerabilities.
2) Classify each vulnerability using DASP categories (e.g., reentrancy, access_control, arithmetic).
3) Return ONLY valid JSON that matches the schema below.
4) If no issues are found, return [].

Schema (informal):
- Array of objects with keys:
  category, title, severity, confidence, evidence{file, lines, function}, explanation, fix_suggestion

Contract:
```solidity
/*
 * @source: https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/known_attacks/
 * @author: consensys
 
 */

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Reentrancy_bonus{

    // INSECURE
    mapping (address => uint) private userBalances;
    mapping (address => bool) private claimedBonus;
    mapping (address => uint) private rewardsForA;

    function withdrawReward(address recipient) public {
        uint amountToWithdraw = rewardsForA[recipient];
        rewardsForA[recipient] = 0;
        (bool success, ) = recipient.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("");
        require(success);
    }

    function getFirstWithdrawalBonus(address recipient) public {
        require(!claimedBonus[recipient]); // Each recipient should only be able to claim the bonus once

        rewardsForA[recipient] += 100;
        
        withdrawReward(recipient); // At this point, the caller will be able to execute getFirstWithdrawalBonus again.
        claimedBonus[recipient] = true;
    }
}
