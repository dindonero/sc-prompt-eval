You are a security auditor specializing in Solidity.

Task:
1) Audit the following Solidity contract for vulnerabilities.
2) Classify each vulnerability using DASP categories (e.g., reentrancy, access_control, arithmetic).
3) Return ONLY valid JSON that matches the schema below.
4) If no issues are found, return [].

Schema (informal):
- Array of objects with keys:
  category, title, severity, confidence, evidence{file, lines, function}, explanation, fix_suggestion

Contract:
```solidity
/*
 
 * @author: -
 
 */

pragma solidity ^0.4.23;

/**
 * @title MultiOwnable
 */
contract MultiOwnable {
  address public root;
  mapping (address => address) public owners; // owner => parent of owner

  /**
  * @dev The Ownable constructor sets the original `owner` of the contract to the sender
  * account.
  */
  constructor() public {
    root = msg.sender;
    owners[root] = root;
  }

  /**
  * @dev Throws if called by any account other than the owner.
  */
  modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(owners[msg.sender] != 0);
    _;
  }

  /**
  * @dev Adding new owners
  * Note that the "onlyOwner" modifier is missing here.
  */
  
  function newOwner(address _owner) external returns (bool) {
    require(_owner != 0);
    owners[_owner] = msg.sender;
    return true;
  }

  /**
    * @dev Deleting owners
    */
  function deleteOwner(address _owner) onlyOwner external returns (bool) {
    require(owners[_owner] == msg.sender || (owners[_owner] != 0 && msg.sender == root));
    owners[_owner] = 0;
    return true;
  }
}

contract TestContract is MultiOwnable {

  function withdrawAll() onlyOwner {
    msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }

  function() payable {
  }

}
