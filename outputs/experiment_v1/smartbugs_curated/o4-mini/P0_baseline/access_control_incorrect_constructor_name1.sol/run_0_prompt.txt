You are a security auditor specializing in Solidity.

Task:
1) Audit the following Solidity contract for vulnerabilities.
2) Classify each vulnerability using DASP categories (e.g., reentrancy, access_control, arithmetic).
3) Return ONLY valid JSON that matches the schema below.
4) If no issues are found, return [].

Schema (informal):
- Array of objects with keys:
  category, title, severity, confidence, evidence{file, lines, function}, explanation, fix_suggestion

Contract:
```solidity
/*
 * @source: https://github.com/trailofbits/not-so-smart-contracts/blob/master/wrong_constructor_name/incorrect_constructor.sol
 * @author: Ben Perez
 
 */

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Missing{
    address private owner;

    modifier onlyowner {
        require(msg.sender==owner);
        _;
    }

    // The name of the constructor should be Missing
    // Anyone can call the IamMissing once the contract is deployed
    
    function IamMissing()
        public
    {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function () payable {}

    function withdraw()
        public
        onlyowner
    {
       owner.transfer(this.balance);
    }
}
