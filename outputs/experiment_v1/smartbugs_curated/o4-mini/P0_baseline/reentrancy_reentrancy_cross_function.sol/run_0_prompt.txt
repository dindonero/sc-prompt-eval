You are a security auditor specializing in Solidity.

Task:
1) Audit the following Solidity contract for vulnerabilities.
2) Classify each vulnerability using DASP categories (e.g., reentrancy, access_control, arithmetic).
3) Return ONLY valid JSON that matches the schema below.
4) If no issues are found, return [].

Schema (informal):
- Array of objects with keys:
  category, title, severity, confidence, evidence{file, lines, function}, explanation, fix_suggestion

Contract:
```solidity
/*
 * @source: https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/known_attacks/
 * @author: consensys
 
 */

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Reentrancy_cross_function {

    // INSECURE
    mapping (address => uint) private userBalances;

    function transfer(address to, uint amount) {
        if (userBalances[msg.sender] >= amount) {
            userBalances[to] += amount;
            userBalances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        }
    }

    function withdrawBalance() public {
        uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];
        
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)(""); // At this point, the caller's code is executed, and can call transfer()
        require(success);
        userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;
    }
}
