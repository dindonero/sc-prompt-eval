You are a security auditor specializing in Solidity.

Task:
1) Audit the following Solidity contract for vulnerabilities.
2) Classify each vulnerability using DASP categories (e.g., reentrancy, access_control, arithmetic).
3) Return ONLY valid JSON that matches the schema below.
4) If no issues are found, return [].

Schema (informal):
- Array of objects with keys:
  category, title, severity, confidence, evidence{file, lines, function}, explanation, fix_suggestion

Contract:
```solidity
/*
 * @source: https://github.com/trailofbits/not-so-smart-contracts/blob/master/unprotected_function/Unprotected.sol
 * @author: -
 
 */

 pragma solidity ^0.4.15;

 contract Unprotected{
     address private owner;

     modifier onlyowner {
         require(msg.sender==owner);
         _;
     }

     function Unprotected()
         public
     {
         owner = msg.sender;
     }

     // This function should be protected
     
     function changeOwner(address _newOwner)
         public
     {
        owner = _newOwner;
     }

    /*
    function changeOwner_fixed(address _newOwner)
         public
         onlyowner
     {
        owner = _newOwner;
     }
