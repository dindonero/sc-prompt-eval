2) Classify each vulnerability using DASP categories (e.g., reentrancy, access_control, arithmetic).
3) Return ONLY valid JSON that matches the schema below.
4) If no issues are found, return [].

Schema (informal):

    address private owner;

    modifier onlyowner {
        require(msg.sender==owner);
        _;
    }
    
    function missing()
        public
