You are a security auditor specializing in Solidity.

Task:
1) Audit the following Solidity contract for vulnerabilities.
2) Classify each vulnerability using DASP categories (e.g., reentrancy, access_control, arithmetic).
3) Return ONLY valid JSON that matches the schema below.
4) If no issues are found, return [].

Schema (informal):
- Array of objects with keys:
  category, title, severity, confidence, evidence{file, lines, function}, explanation, fix_suggestion

Contract:
```solidity
/*
 * @source: etherscan.io 
 * @author: -
 
 */

pragma solidity ^0.4.23;

/*
!!! THIS CONTRACT IS EXPLOITABLE AND FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY !!!

This smart contract allows a user to (insecurely) store funds
in this smart contract and withdraw them at any later point in time
*/

contract keepMyEther {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
    
    function () payable public {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }
    
    function withdraw() public {
        
        msg.sender.call.value(balances[msg.sender])();
        balances[msg.sender] = 0;
    }
}
