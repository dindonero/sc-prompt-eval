You are a security auditor specializing in Solidity.

Task:
1) Audit the following Solidity contract for vulnerabilities.
2) Classify each vulnerability using DASP categories (e.g., reentrancy, access_control, arithmetic).
3) Return ONLY valid JSON that matches the schema below.
4) If no issues are found, return [].

Schema (informal):
- Array of objects with keys:
  category, title, severity, confidence, evidence{file, lines, function}, explanation, fix_suggestion

Contract:
```solidity

 */

 pragma solidity ^0.4.22;

 contract Phishable {
    address public owner;

    constructor (address _owner) {
        owner = _owner;
    }

    function () public payable {} // collect ether

    function withdrawAll(address _recipient) public {
        
        require(tx.origin == owner);
        _recipient.transfer(this.balance);
    }
}
