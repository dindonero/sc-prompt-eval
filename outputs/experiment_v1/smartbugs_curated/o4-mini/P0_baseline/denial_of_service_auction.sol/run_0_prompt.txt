You are a security auditor specializing in Solidity.

Task:
1) Audit the following Solidity contract for vulnerabilities.
2) Classify each vulnerability using DASP categories (e.g., reentrancy, access_control, arithmetic).
3) Return ONLY valid JSON that matches the schema below.
4) If no issues are found, return [].

Schema (informal):
- Array of objects with keys:
  category, title, severity, confidence, evidence{file, lines, function}, explanation, fix_suggestion

Contract:
```solidity
/*
 * @source: https://github.com/trailofbits/not-so-smart-contracts/blob/master/denial_of_service/auction.sol
 * @author: -
 
 */

pragma solidity ^0.4.15;

//Auction susceptible to DoS attack
contract DosAuction {
  address currentFrontrunner;
  uint currentBid;

  //Takes in bid, refunding the frontrunner if they are outbid
  function bid() payable {
    require(msg.value > currentBid);

    //If the refund fails, the entire transaction reverts.
    //Therefore a frontrunner who always fails will win
    if (currentFrontrunner != 0) {
      //E.g. if recipients fallback function is just revert()
      
      require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));
    }

    currentFrontrunner = msg.sender;
    currentBid         = msg.value;
  }
}
