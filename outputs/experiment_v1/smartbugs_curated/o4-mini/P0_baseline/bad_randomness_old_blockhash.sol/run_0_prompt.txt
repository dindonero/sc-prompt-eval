You are a security auditor specializing in Solidity.

Task:
1) Audit the following Solidity contract for vulnerabilities.
2) Classify each vulnerability using DASP categories (e.g., reentrancy, access_control, arithmetic).
3) Return ONLY valid JSON that matches the schema below.
4) If no issues are found, return [].

Schema (informal):
- Array of objects with keys:
  category, title, severity, confidence, evidence{file, lines, function}, explanation, fix_suggestion

Contract:
```solidity
/*

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

//Based on the the Capture the Ether challange at https://capturetheether.com/challenges/lotteries/predict-the-block-hash/
//Note that while it seems to have a 1/2^256 chance you guess the right hash, actually blockhash returns zero for blocks numbers that are more than 256 blocks ago so you can guess zero and wait.
contract PredictTheBlockHashChallenge {

    struct guess{
      uint block;
      bytes32 guess;
    }

    mapping(address => guess) guesses;

    constructor() public payable {
        require(msg.value == 1 ether);
    }

    function lockInGuess(bytes32 hash) public payable {
        require(guesses[msg.sender].block == 0);
        require(msg.value == 1 ether);

        guesses[msg.sender].guess = hash;
        guesses[msg.sender].block  = block.number + 1;
    }

    function settle() public {
        require(block.number > guesses[msg.sender].block);
        
        bytes32 answer = blockhash(guesses[msg.sender].block);

        guesses[msg.sender].block = 0;
        if (guesses[msg.sender].guess == answer) {
            msg.sender.transfer(2 ether);
        }
    }
}
