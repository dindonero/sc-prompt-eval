## IN-CONTEXT LEARNING EXAMPLES

The following are examples of real vulnerabilities with expert analysis. Study how the vulnerabilities are identified and explained, then apply the same analytical approach to the target contract.

### EXAMPLE 1: ACCESS_CONTROL VULNERABILITY

**Vulnerable Code:**
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract DelegateCaller {
    uint public n;
    function delegatecallSetN(address _e, uint _n) public {
        if (! _e.delegatecall(bytes4(keccak256("setN(uint256)")), _n))
            revert();
    }
}
```

**Security Analysis:**
This code contains a access_control vulnerability.

Here’s a concise, step-by-step, refined explanation:

1. The risky pattern  
   • The function  
       delegatecallSetN(address _e, uint256 _v)  
     is declared public—anyone can invoke it.  
   • It does  
       _e.delegatecall(abi.encodeWithSelector(setN.selector, _v));  
     meaning it will execute code at the supplied address `_e` but in the *storage context* of the calling contract (`DelegateCaller`).  

2. Why this is an access-control issue  
   • There is no `onlyOwner` or similar guard on delegatecallSetN—nobody checks who is calling.  
   • Because the callee’s code runs with DelegateCaller’s storage layout, a malicious contract can overwrite any storage slot (owner, balances, flags, etc.) or even self-destruct DelegateCaller.  
   • In effect, you’ve handed out your private storage keys to anyone who calls this function with an attacker-controlled address.  

3. The attacker’s exploit flow  
   a. Attacker deploys a malicious contract:  
       contract Evil {  
         // Matches the selector setN(uint256)  
         function setN(uint _ignored) public {  
           // Overwrite the "owner" slot in DelegateCaller  
           assembly { sstore(0, caller()) }  
         }  
       }  
   b. Attacker calls  
       delegatecallSetN(evilAddress, 0)  
   c. DelegateCaller performs a delegatecall into Evil.setN, which stores the attacker’s address into slot 0 (the owner variable), seizing control.  

4. Conditions that make it exploitable  
   • delegatecallSetN is public and unprotected.  
   • The function accepts an arbitrary target address and blindly delegatecalls into it.  
   • delegatecall preserves the caller’s storage context, letting injected code mutate *any* slot.  

Summary  
By exposing a public delegatecall to a user-supplied contract, you effectively grant anyone the ability to run arbitrary code against your contract’s storage. That is a classic, severe access-control vulnerability—attackers can seize ownership or corrupt critical state at will.


**Classification**: This code contains a **access_control** vulnerability.

### EXAMPLE 2: DENIAL_OF_SERVICE VULNERABILITY

**Vulnerable Code:**
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract DelegateCaller {
    uint public n;
    function delegatecallSetN(address _e, uint _n) public {
        if (! _e.delegatecall(bytes4(keccak256("setN(uint256)")), _n))
            revert();
    }
}
```

**Security Analysis:**
This code contains a denial_of_service vulnerability.

Here’s a concise, accurate and complete explanation of the vulnerability, how an attacker exploits it, and the conditions that enable the DoS:

1. Vulnerable pattern in the code  
   • Function delegatecallSetN(address _e, uint256 _n) lets *any* caller supply the address `_e`.  
   • It then does  
     delegatecall(bytes4(keccak256("setN(uint256)")), _n)  
     and immediately reverts if that delegatecall returns false.  
   • In effect, you’re delegating execution (and storage access) to a user‐supplied contract and declaring “any failure = full revert.”

2. Attack vector  
   • Attacker deploys a malicious contract `Evil` with a setN signature:  
     function setN(uint256) public returns (bool) { revert(); }  
     (or simply never returns true).  
   • Attacker calls delegatecallSetN(evilAddress, someValue).  
   • The delegatecall into `Evil.setN` either reverts or returns false.  
   • delegatecallSetN sees the failure and immediately reverts.  
   • Once `Evil` is known, *every* subsequent call to delegatecallSetN(evilAddress, …) will revert, blocking legitimate usage.

3. Enabling conditions for permanent DoS  
   • You allow callers to choose the delegatecall target address.  
   • You interpret *any* delegatecall failure as a trigger to revert, with no fallback or alternative path.  
   • Delegatecall runs in your contract’s context—so the malicious contract can consume all gas or explicitly revert.  
   • There’s no rate‐limit, no whitelisting, and no recovery mechanism, so the attacker can repeat this forever.

Key takeaway: Never delegatecall into a user‐controlled address with a hard revert on failure. At minimum, restrict the set of allowed target addresses or handle failures gracefully (e.g. return an error code instead of reverting).


**Classification**: This code contains a **denial_of_service** vulnerability.

### EXAMPLE 3: BAD_RANDOMNESS VULNERABILITY

**Vulnerable Code:**
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract blockHashNotReturned {
    function currentBlockHash() public returns (bytes32 b) {
        return blockhash(block.number); 
    }
    function currentBlockHashCst() constant public returns (bytes32 b) {
        return blockhash(block.number); 
    }
}
```

**Security Analysis:**
This code contains a bad_randomness vulnerability.

Here’s a concise, accurate and complete summary of why using blockhash(block.number) is a “bad randomness” vulnerability, how it can be attacked, and what to do instead.

1. What the code does (and where it breaks)  
   • Vulnerable pattern: calling  
     blockhash(block.number)  
   • Solidity’s rule: blockhash(n) only returns a real 256-bit hash for blocks in the range (currentBlock – 1) down to (currentBlock – 256).  
   • For any other block number—including the current one—Solidity returns 0x00…00.  

2. Why it’s not random  
   • You cannot know a block’s hash until it has been mined. To avoid undefined or revert behavior, Solidity simply hardcodes blockhash(block.number) = 0.  
   • Any “randomness” derived from that (for example, doing modulo operations on it) collapses to a constant value every time it’s called.  

3. How an attacker abuses it  
   • The attacker inspects your contract code and sees that the “random” seed is always zero.  
   • They compute the outcome off-chain (it’s always the same).  
   • They only call your function when that fixed outcome benefits them—or they never lose, because it never changes.  

4. Preconditions for exploitation  
   • Your contract must trust blockhash(block.number) (or any miner-influenced/undefined on-chain field) as a source of entropy.  
   • The attacker must be able to observe that value or predict it before deciding to interact.  
   • No additional entropy or commit–reveal scheme is used to mask or delay knowledge of the seed.  

5. Correct mitigation strategies  
   • Use a verified external randomness oracle such as Chainlink VRF, which returns on-chain provably fair random numbers.  
   • Implement a commit–reveal scheme in which users commit to a secret value in one transaction and reveal it later, preventing pre-mining prediction.  
   • Combine multiple independent sources of entropy (e.g. user seeds, blockhash of past block, chainlink) and apply a secure hash function.  

Takeaway: blockhash(block.number) is always zero and thus never random. Relying on it for lotteries, games, or any “unpredictable” logic is insecure. Always use battle-tested randomness patterns or oracles.


**Classification**: This code contains a **bad_randomness** vulnerability.

### EXAMPLE 4: REENTRANCY VULNERABILITY

**Vulnerable Code:**
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract SimpleDAO {
  mapping (address => uint) public credit;
    
  function donate(address to) payable public{
    credit[to] += msg.value;
  }
    
  function withdraw(uint amount) public{
    if (credit[msg.sender]>= amount) {
      require(msg.sender.call.value(amount)());
      credit[msg.sender]-=amount;
    }
  }  

  function queryCredit(address to) view public returns(uint){
    return credit[to];
  }
}

```

**Security Analysis:**
Here’s a concise, final explanation:

1. What the contract does  
   • donate(address to) – Anyone can send ETH and credit it to any address.  
   • withdraw(uint amount) – Lets msg.sender pull out up to their credited balance. It does:  
     a. require(credit[msg.sender] ≥ amount)  
     b. msg.sender.call.value(amount)()  ← external call  
     c. credit[msg.sender] -= amount       ← state update  
   • queryCredit(address) – Returns the stored balance for that address.  

2. Where the vulnerability lies  
   • The external call to msg.sender happens before the contract updates credit[msg.sender].  
   • During that call, if msg.sender is a malicious contract, its fallback function can reenter withdraw() (because their credit hasn’t yet been reduced).  
   • Each reentrant call will pass the require check and pull out more ETH, draining the contract.  

3. Attack outline  
   • Attacker contract deposits some ETH via donate(), increasing its credit.  
   • Attacker calls withdraw(amount). In the fallback of that call, it immediately calls withdraw(amount) again.  
   • Because the credit is only subtracted after the external call, the attacker can loop until the contract is drained or gas runs out.  

4. Impact and conditions for exploitation  
   • Full reentrancy drain of any ETH held by this contract.  
   • Requires no special privileges—any user who can deposit and then withdraw can exploit it via a malicious fallback.  

5. Mitigations  
   • Follow Checks-Effects-Interactions: update the user’s balance before making any external call.  
   • Or use a reentrancy guard (e.g. OpenZeppelin’s ReentrancyGuard).  
   • In newer Solidity, consider using transfer() (2300 gas stipend) or call with a well-defined gas limit.


**Classification**: This code contains a **reentrancy** vulnerability.

### EXAMPLE 5: UNCHECKED_LOW_LEVEL_CALLS VULNERABILITY

**Vulnerable Code:**
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract SimpleDAO {
  mapping (address => uint) public credit;
    
  function donate(address to) payable public{
    credit[to] += msg.value;
  }
    
  function withdraw(uint amount) public{
    if (credit[msg.sender]>= amount) {
      require(msg.sender.call.value(amount)());
      credit[msg.sender]-=amount;
    }
  }  

  function queryCredit(address to) view public returns(uint){
    return credit[to];
  }
}

```

**Security Analysis:**
This code contains a unchecked_low_level_calls vulnerability.

Yes—your write-up correctly pinpoints the vulnerable code, clearly walks through the re-entrancy attack, and enumerates the enabling conditions. Below is a final, polished explanation:

1. Vulnerable Code Pattern  
   • In withdraw(), funds are sent via a low-level call before updating user state:  
     ```
     require(
       msg.sender.call.value(amount)()
     );
     credit[msg.sender] -= amount;
     ```  
   • call.value(amount)()  
     – Forwards all remaining gas to the recipient  
     – Invokes the recipient’s fallback/receive function  
     – Returns only a success flag to the caller  

2. Why It’s Unsafe  
   • Even though require(...) checks the boolean, the external call hands control (and full gas) to the recipient before any state change.  
   • This ordering violates the checks-effects-interactions pattern.  

3. Attack Vector (Re-entrancy)  
   1. Attacker deploys a malicious contract with fallback/receive that calls back into SimpleDAO.withdraw().  
   2. Attacker seeds its credit by donating some Ether to SimpleDAO.  
   3. Attacker calls SimpleDAO.withdraw(x):  
      – SimpleDAO executes call.value(x)(), transferring x Ether and entering the attacker’s fallback.  
      – Attacker’s fallback immediately calls withdraw(x) again.  
   4. Because credit[attacker] has not yet been decremented, the second withdrawal succeeds.  
   5. This loop repeats until the DAO runs out of funds (or gas).  

4. Enabling Conditions  
   • Use of address.call.value(...)() forwards all gas and invokes untrusted code.  
   • State update (credit[msg.sender] –= amount) occurs after the external call.  
   • No re-entrancy guard or mutex to prevent recursive entry.  

Summary  
By making an unchecked low-level call before updating balances, the contract allows an attacker’s fallback function to re-enter withdraw() multiple times and withdraw far more than their credit. Fixing it requires reordering to update state before external calls (checks-effects-interactions) or introducing a re-entrancy guard.


**Classification**: This code contains a **unchecked_low_level_calls** vulnerability.
