    "rendered_prompt": "## SMART CONTRACT SECURITY AUDIT WITH LEARNED EXAMPLES\n\nYou are a security auditor specializing in Solidity smart contracts. Below are examples of vulnerable contracts with detailed security analysis. **Learn from these examples** to analyze the target contract.\n\n---\n\n## IN-CONTEXT LEARNING EXAMPLES\n\nThe following are examples of real vulnerabilities with expert analysis. Study how the vulnerabilities are identified and explained, then apply the same analytical approach to the target contract.\n\n### EXAMPLE 1: DENIAL_OF_SERVICE VULNERABILITY\n\n**Vulnerable Code:**\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\n\ncontract DelegateCaller {\n    uint public n;\n    function delegatecallSetN(address _e, uint _n) public {\n        if (! _e.delegatecall(bytes4(keccak256(\"setN(uint256)\")), _n))\n            revert();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Security Analysis:**\nThis code contains a denial_of_service vulnerability.\n\nHere\u2019s a concise, accurate and complete explanation of the vulnerability, how an attacker exploits it, and the conditions that enable the DoS:\n\n1. Vulnerable pattern in the code  \n   \u2022 Function delegatecallSetN(address _e, uint256 _n) lets *any* caller supply the address `_e`.  \n   \u2022 It then does  \n     delegatecall(bytes4(keccak256(\"setN(uint256)\")), _n)  \n     and immediately reverts if that delegatecall returns false.  \n   \u2022 In effect, you\u2019re delegating execution (and storage access) to a user\u2010supplied contract and declaring \u201cany failure = full revert.\u201d\n\n2. Attack vector  \n   \u2022 Attacker deploys a malicious contract `Evil` with a setN signature:  \n     function setN(uint256) public returns (bool) { revert(); }  \n     (or simply never returns true).  \n   \u2022 Attacker calls delegatecallSetN(evilAddress, someValue).  \n   \u2022 The delegatecall into `Evil.setN` either reverts or returns false.  \n   \u2022 delegatecallSetN sees the failure and immediately reverts.  \n   \u2022 Once `Evil` is known, *every* subsequent call to delegatecallSetN(evilAddress, \u2026) will revert, blocking legitimate usage.\n\n3. Enabling conditions for permanent DoS  \n   \u2022 You allow callers to choose the delegatecall target address.  \n   \u2022 You interpret *any* delegatecall failure as a trigger to revert, with no fallback or alternative path.  \n   \u2022 Delegatecall runs in your contract\u2019s context\u2014so the malicious contract can consume all gas or explicitly revert.  \n   \u2022 There\u2019s no rate\u2010limit, no whitelisting, and no recovery mechanism, so the attacker can repeat this forever.\n\nKey takeaway: Never delegatecall into a user\u2010controlled address with a hard revert on failure. At minimum, restrict the set of allowed target addresses or handle failures gracefully (e.g. return an error code instead of reverting).\n\n\n**Classification**: This code contains a **denial_of_service** vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### EXAMPLE 2: ACCESS_CONTROL VULNERABILITY\n\n**Vulnerable Code:**\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\n\ncontract DelegateCaller {\n    uint public n;\n    function delegatecallSetN(address _e, uint _n) public {\n        if (! _e.delegatecall(bytes4(keccak256(\"setN(uint256)\")), _n))\n            revert();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Security Analysis:**\nThis code contains a access_control vulnerability.\n\nHere\u2019s a concise, step-by-step, refined explanation:\n\n1. The risky pattern  \n   \u2022 The function  \n       delegatecallSetN(address _e, uint256 _v)  \n     is declared public\u2014anyone can invoke it.  \n   \u2022 It does  \n       _e.delegatecall(abi.encodeWithSelector(setN.selector, _v));  \n     meaning it will execute code at the supplied address `_e` but in the *storage context* of the calling contract (`DelegateCaller`).  \n\n2. Why this is an access-control issue  \n   \u2022 There is no `onlyOwner` or similar guard on delegatecallSetN\u2014nobody checks who is calling.  \n   \u2022 Because the callee\u2019s code runs with DelegateCaller\u2019s storage layout, a malicious contract can overwrite any storage slot (owner, balances, flags, etc.) or even self-destruct DelegateCaller.  \n   \u2022 In effect, you\u2019ve handed out your private storage keys to anyone who calls this function with an attacker-controlled address.  \n\n3. The attacker\u2019s exploit flow  \n   a. Attacker deploys a malicious contract:  \n       contract Evil {  \n         // Matches the selector setN(uint256)  \n         function setN(uint _ignored) public {  \n           // Overwrite the \"owner\" slot in DelegateCaller  \n           assembly { sstore(0, caller()) }  \n         }  \n       }  \n   b. Attacker calls  \n       delegatecallSetN(evilAddress, 0)  \n   c. DelegateCaller performs a delegatecall into Evil.setN, which stores the attacker\u2019s address into slot 0 (the owner variable), seizing control.  \n\n4. Conditions that make it exploitable  \n   \u2022 delegatecallSetN is public and unprotected.  \n   \u2022 The function accepts an arbitrary target address and blindly delegatecalls into it.  \n   \u2022 delegatecall preserves the caller\u2019s storage context, letting injected code mutate *any* slot.  \n\nSummary  \nBy exposing a public delegatecall to a user-supplied contract, you effectively grant anyone the ability to run arbitrary code against your contract\u2019s storage. That is a classic, severe access-control vulnerability\u2014attackers can seize ownership or corrupt critical state at will.\n\n\n**Classification**: This code contains a **access_control** vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### EXAMPLE 3: ARITHMETIC VULNERABILITY\n\n**Vulnerable Code:**\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\n\ncontract cryptocurrencyClubTest {\n    \n    uint originalTime;\n    \n    constructor() public{\n        originalTime = now;\n    }\n    \n    \n    \n    function BirthdayBoyClickHere() public view returns(string) {\n        require(now < originalTime + 23 hours);\n        return \"Happy Birthday Harrison! I know this contract is noobish but I will get better.\";\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\n**Security Analysis:**\nThis code contains a arithmetic vulnerability.\n\nI\u2019d love to give you a precise, polished write-up\u2014but I\u2019m flying a bit blind without seeing the actual contract. To be sure my explanation:\n\n 1. accurately pinpoints the vulnerable lines  \n 2. clearly walks through exactly how an attacker could take advantage  \n 3. fully enumerates every precondition (block number, token balance, role assignment, etc.)  \n\nI\u2019ll need the Solidity (or Vyper) code you want me to review. Could you please paste in:\n\n \u2022 The contract (or the relevant functions and state variables)  \n \u2022 Any inherited contracts or interfaces that define access controls  \n \u2022 How you\u2019re invoking or testing the vulnerable function  \n\nOnce I have that, I can re-audit:\n\n \u2013 Externally-called functions (reentrancy, missing modifiers)  \n \u2013 Permissions checks (onlyOwner/onlyRole, unguarded paths)  \n \u2013 Integer math (under/overflows, safe-math omissions)  \n \u2013 Return-value checks on ERC20/ERC721 calls  \n \u2013 Block or timestamp\u2013based logic (time locks, cooldowns)  \n\nand then deliver a final, bullet-proof explanation of the issue, the exact attack flow, and how to mitigate it.\n\n\n**Classification**: This code contains a **arithmetic** vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### EXAMPLE 4: BAD_RANDOMNESS VULNERABILITY\n\n**Vulnerable Code:**\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\n\ncontract blockHashNotReturned {\n    function currentBlockHash() public returns (bytes32 b) {\n        return blockhash(block.number); \n    }\n    function currentBlockHashCst() constant public returns (bytes32 b) {\n        return blockhash(block.number); \n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Security Analysis:**\nThis code contains a bad_randomness vulnerability.\n\nHere\u2019s a concise, accurate and complete summary of why using blockhash(block.number) is a \u201cbad randomness\u201d vulnerability, how it can be attacked, and what to do instead.\n\n1. What the code does (and where it breaks)  \n   \u2022 Vulnerable pattern: calling  \n     blockhash(block.number)  \n   \u2022 Solidity\u2019s rule: blockhash(n) only returns a real 256-bit hash for blocks in the range (currentBlock \u2013 1) down to (currentBlock \u2013 256).  \n   \u2022 For any other block number\u2014including the current one\u2014Solidity returns 0x00\u202600.  \n\n2. Why it\u2019s not random  \n   \u2022 You cannot know a block\u2019s hash until it has been mined. To avoid undefined or revert behavior, Solidity simply hardcodes blockhash(block.number) = 0.  \n   \u2022 Any \u201crandomness\u201d derived from that (for example, doing modulo operations on it) collapses to a constant value every time it\u2019s called.  \n\n3. How an attacker abuses it  \n   \u2022 The attacker inspects your contract code and sees that the \u201crandom\u201d seed is always zero.  \n   \u2022 They compute the outcome off-chain (it\u2019s always the same).  \n   \u2022 They only call your function when that fixed outcome benefits them\u2014or they never lose, because it never changes.  \n\n4. Preconditions for exploitation  \n   \u2022 Your contract must trust blockhash(block.number) (or any miner-influenced/undefined on-chain field) as a source of entropy.  \n   \u2022 The attacker must be able to observe that value or predict it before deciding to interact.  \n   \u2022 No additional entropy or commit\u2013reveal scheme is used to mask or delay knowledge of the seed.  \n\n5. Correct mitigation strategies  \n   \u2022 Use a verified external randomness oracle such as Chainlink VRF, which returns on-chain provably fair random numbers.  \n   \u2022 Implement a commit\u2013reveal scheme in which users commit to a secret value in one transaction and reveal it later, preventing pre-mining prediction.  \n   \u2022 Combine multiple independent sources of entropy (e.g. user seeds, blockhash of past block, chainlink) and apply a secure hash function.  \n\nTakeaway: blockhash(block.number) is always zero and thus never random. Relying on it for lotteries, games, or any \u201cunpredictable\u201d logic is insecure. Always use battle-tested randomness patterns or oracles.\n\n\n**Classification**: This code contains a **bad_randomness** vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### EXAMPLE 5: REENTRANCY VULNERABILITY\n\n**Vulnerable Code:**\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\n\ncontract SimpleDAO {\n  mapping (address => uint) public credit;\n    \n  function donate(address to) payable public{\n    credit[to] += msg.value;\n  }\n    \n  function withdraw(uint amount) public{\n    if (credit[msg.sender]>= amount) {\n      require(msg.sender.call.value(amount)());\n      credit[msg.sender]-=amount;\n    }\n  }  \n\n  function queryCredit(address to) view public returns(uint){\n    return credit[to];\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n**Security Analysis:**\nYes\u2014your original analysis correctly pinpoints the vulnerable pattern, explains exactly how an attacker abuses it, and lists the conditions needed for the exploit. Here is a concise, polished explanation:\n\n1. What the contract does  \n   \u2022 Keeps a per-address balance in `credit`.  \n   \u2022 `donate(address to)` lets anyone send Ether and increases `credit[to]` by the sent amount.  \n   \u2022 `withdraw(uint amount)`  \n     \u2013 Checks that the caller\u2019s `credit` \u2265 `amount`.  \n     \u2013 Sends `amount` with `msg.sender.call.value(amount)()` (forwards all remaining gas).  \n     \u2013 **After** the transfer, subtracts `amount` from the caller\u2019s `credit`.  \n   \u2022 `queryCredit(address to)` returns the stored balance.\n\n2. Vulnerable pattern  \n   \u2022 External call (`.call.value(...)()`) happens before the contract\u2019s state is updated.  \n   \u2022 No reentrancy guard (e.g. `mutex` or the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern).  \n   \u2022 `.call.value(...)()` forwards all remaining gas, so a malicious fallback can do almost anything.\n\n3. Attack vector  \n   A malicious contract calls `withdraw(x)`.  \n   \u2013 In the fallback function (triggered by `.call.value(...)()`), it calls `withdraw(x)` again because its `credit` hasn\u2019t yet been decreased.  \n   \u2013 This loop repeats until the victim contract runs out of Ether.\n\n4. Conditions for exploitation  \n   \u2022 The victim uses a low-level call that forwards all gas.  \n   \u2022 Balance is decremented **after** the external call.  \n   \u2022 No reentrancy protection.\n\n5. Fixes  \n   \u2022 Follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern:  \n     1. Check conditions.  \n     2. Update state (`credit[msg.sender] -= amount`).  \n     3. Make external calls.  \n   \u2022 Or use OpenZeppelin\u2019s `ReentrancyGuard` modifier.  \n   \u2022 Or use `.transfer()` / `.send()` (2300 gas stipend) if you\u2019re sure that\u2019s sufficient.\n\n\n**Classification**: This code contains a **reentrancy** vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n\n## TARGET CONTRACT FOR ANALYSIS\n\nNow apply the same analytical approach demonstrated above to this contract:\n\n```solidity\n/*\n \n * @author: -\n \n */\n\n//Single transaction overflow\n//Post-transaction effect: overflow escapes to publicly-readable storage\n\npragma solidity ^0.4.19;\n\ncontract IntegerOverflowMul {\n    uint public count = 2;\n\n    function run(uint256 input) public {\n        \n        count *= input;\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n---\n\n## YOUR ANALYSIS\n\nFollowing the pattern shown in the examples:\n\n### 1.
