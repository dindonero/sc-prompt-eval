## IN-CONTEXT LEARNING EXAMPLES

The following are examples of real vulnerabilities with expert analysis. Study how the vulnerabilities are identified and explained, then apply the same analytical approach to the target contract.

### EXAMPLE 1: DENIAL_OF_SERVICE VULNERABILITY

**Vulnerable Code:**
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract DelegateCaller {
    uint public n;
    function delegatecallSetN(address _e, uint _n) public {
        if (! _e.delegatecall(bytes4(keccak256("setN(uint256)")), _n))
            revert();
    }
}
```

**Security Analysis:**
This code contains a denial_of_service vulnerability.

Here’s a concise, accurate and complete explanation of the vulnerability, how an attacker exploits it, and the conditions that enable the DoS:

1. Vulnerable pattern in the code  
   • Function delegatecallSetN(address _e, uint256 _n) lets *any* caller supply the address `_e`.  
   • It then does  
     delegatecall(bytes4(keccak256("setN(uint256)")), _n)  
     and immediately reverts if that delegatecall returns false.  
   • In effect, you’re delegating execution (and storage access) to a user‐supplied contract and declaring “any failure = full revert.”

2. Attack vector  
   • Attacker deploys a malicious contract `Evil` with a setN signature:  
     function setN(uint256) public returns (bool) { revert(); }  
     (or simply never returns true).  
   • Attacker calls delegatecallSetN(evilAddress, someValue).  
   • The delegatecall into `Evil.setN` either reverts or returns false.  
   • delegatecallSetN sees the failure and immediately reverts.  
   • Once `Evil` is known, *every* subsequent call to delegatecallSetN(evilAddress, …) will revert, blocking legitimate usage.

3. Enabling conditions for permanent DoS  
   • You allow callers to choose the delegatecall target address.  
   • You interpret *any* delegatecall failure as a trigger to revert, with no fallback or alternative path.  
   • Delegatecall runs in your contract’s context—so the malicious contract can consume all gas or explicitly revert.  
   • There’s no rate‐limit, no whitelisting, and no recovery mechanism, so the attacker can repeat this forever.

Key takeaway: Never delegatecall into a user‐controlled address with a hard revert on failure. At minimum, restrict the set of allowed target addresses or handle failures gracefully (e.g. return an error code instead of reverting).


**Classification**: This code contains a **denial_of_service** vulnerability.

### EXAMPLE 2: ACCESS_CONTROL VULNERABILITY

**Vulnerable Code:**
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract DelegateCaller {
    uint public n;
    function delegatecallSetN(address _e, uint _n) public {
        if (! _e.delegatecall(bytes4(keccak256("setN(uint256)")), _n))
            revert();
    }
}
```

**Security Analysis:**
This code contains a access_control vulnerability.

Here’s a concise, step-by-step, refined explanation:

1. The risky pattern  
   • The function  
       delegatecallSetN(address _e, uint256 _v)  
     is declared public—anyone can invoke it.  
   • It does  
       _e.delegatecall(abi.encodeWithSelector(setN.selector, _v));  
     meaning it will execute code at the supplied address `_e` but in the *storage context* of the calling contract (`DelegateCaller`).  

2. Why this is an access-control issue  
   • There is no `onlyOwner` or similar guard on delegatecallSetN—nobody checks who is calling.  
   • Because the callee’s code runs with DelegateCaller’s storage layout, a malicious contract can overwrite any storage slot (owner, balances, flags, etc.) or even self-destruct DelegateCaller.  
   • In effect, you’ve handed out your private storage keys to anyone who calls this function with an attacker-controlled address.  

3. The attacker’s exploit flow  
   a. Attacker deploys a malicious contract:  
       contract Evil {  
         // Matches the selector setN(uint256)  
         function setN(uint _ignored) public {  
           // Overwrite the "owner" slot in DelegateCaller  
           assembly { sstore(0, caller()) }  
         }  
       }  
   b. Attacker calls  
       delegatecallSetN(evilAddress, 0)  
   c. DelegateCaller performs a delegatecall into Evil.setN, which stores the attacker’s address into slot 0 (the owner variable), seizing control.  

4. Conditions that make it exploitable  
   • delegatecallSetN is public and unprotected.  
   • The function accepts an arbitrary target address and blindly delegatecalls into it.  
   • delegatecall preserves the caller’s storage context, letting injected code mutate *any* slot.  

Summary  
By exposing a public delegatecall to a user-supplied contract, you effectively grant anyone the ability to run arbitrary code against your contract’s storage. That is a classic, severe access-control vulnerability—attackers can seize ownership or corrupt critical state at will.


**Classification**: This code contains a **access_control** vulnerability.

### EXAMPLE 3: REENTRANCY VULNERABILITY

**Vulnerable Code:**
```solidity
contract SendBalance {
 mapping (address => uint) userBalances ;
 bool withdrawn = false ;
 function getBalance(address u) constant returns (uint){
    return userBalances[u];
 }
 function addToBalance() {
    userBalances msg.sender] += msg.value ;
 }
 function withdrawBalance(){
    if (!(msg.sender.call.value(userBalances[msg.sender])())) { throw ; }
    userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;
 }
}

```

**Security Analysis:**
Final Verdict  
• VULNERABLE  
• CATEGORY: Reentrancy (unsafe low-level call)  
• CONFIDENCE: 90%  

Refined Explanation  

1. What the contract does  
   – Keeps track of Ether deposits per address in userBalances.  
   – addToBalance lets any user deposit Ether and credits msg.value to their mapping slot.  
   – withdrawBalance attempts to send the user’s entire balance back via a low-level call, then zeros out their balance.  
   – getBalance simply returns anyone’s stored balance.  

2. The flaw (reentrancy)  
   – withdrawBalance performs the external call (msg.sender.call.value(amount)()) before updating state.  
   – If msg.sender is a contract, its fallback can reenter withdrawBalance again.  
   – Because userBalances[msg.sender] isn’t zeroed yet, each reentrant call sees the full original balance and sends it again.  

3. Attack scenario step-by-step  
   1. Attacker contract calls addToBalance with some Ether, so userBalances[attacker] = X.  
   2. Attacker calls withdrawBalance().  
   3. withdrawBalance does call.value(X)() → control flows into attacker’s fallback.  
   4. In fallback, attacker calls withdrawBalance() again before the first call returns to zero the balance. userBalances[attacker] is still X.  
   5. repeat steps 3–4 until the contract is drained or runs out of gas. Only afterward does the original withdrawBalance reduce userBalances[attacker] to zero—too late.  

4. Why this is complete  
   – No checks-effects-interactions ordering: external call precedes state change.  
   – No reentrancy guard (mutex) in place.  
   – Uses low-level call which forwards all remaining gas andsilently returns false on failure.  

5. Mitigation strategies  
   – Follow Checks-Effects-Interactions: set userBalances[msg.sender] = 0 before making the external call.  
   – Use a reentrancy guard (e.g. OpenZeppelin’s ReentrancyGuard).  
   – Prefer pull-over-push: let users withdraw via a protected function, or use send/transfer with limited gas stipend where appropriate.  

By moving the state update before the external call or by introducing a reentrancy lock, you close this exploit path.


**Classification**: This code contains a **reentrancy** vulnerability.

### EXAMPLE 4: UNCHECKED_LOW_LEVEL_CALLS VULNERABILITY

**Vulnerable Code:**
```solidity
contract SendBalance {
 mapping (address => uint) userBalances ;
 bool withdrawn = false ;
 function getBalance(address u) constant returns (uint){
    return userBalances[u];
 }
 function addToBalance() {
    userBalances msg.sender] += msg.value ;
 }
 function withdrawBalance(){
    if (!(msg.sender.call.value(userBalances[msg.sender])())) { throw ; }
    userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;
 }
}

```

**Security Analysis:**
This code contains a unchecked_low_level_calls vulnerability.

Here’s a final, concise—and I believe accurate—explanation of the issue, how it can be exploited, and how to fix it:

1. What’s wrong (vulnerable code)  
   • In withdrawBalance() the contract does:  
     – External call first:  
       `msg.sender.call.value(userBalances[msg.sender])()`  
     – THEN clears the balance:  
       `userBalances[msg.sender] = 0`  
   • Using low-level `call.value(...)()` means you forward all remaining gas and give up the 2,300-gas safety stipend that `.transfer()` enforces.

2. How an attacker abuses it (attack vector)  
   • Attacker deposits ETH so that `userBalances[attacker] > 0`.  
   • Attacker’s contract implements a fallback/receive that calls back into withdrawBalance().  
   • Because the state (the user’s balance) isn’t reset until after the `.call()`, each reentrant call sees the old balance and drains it again.  
   • With full gas forwarded, there’s enough gas to loop and extract all ETH.

3. Conditions required for exploitation  
   • The attacker must have a non-zero balance in the contract.  
   • The contract must use an unchecked low-level call (no gas cap).  
   • State update (clearing the balance) happens only after the external call.  
   • No reentrancy guard is in place.

4. How to prevent it  
   1. Follow Checks-Effects-Interactions:  
      – Checks (e.g., require statements)  
      – Effects: update `userBalances[msg.sender] = 0`  
      – Interactions: then perform the external call.  
   2. Prefer `payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount)` (limited to 2,300 gas).  
   3. Use a ReentrancyGuard or pull-payment pattern for additional safety.

By updating state before any external call or by using the built-in protections of `.transfer()`, you close the reentrancy window and eliminate the unchecked low-level call vulnerability.


**Classification**: This code contains a **unchecked_low_level_calls** vulnerability.

### EXAMPLE 5: BAD_RANDOMNESS VULNERABILITY

**Vulnerable Code:**
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract blockHashNotReturned {
    function currentBlockHash() public returns (bytes32 b) {
        return blockhash(block.number); 
    }
    function currentBlockHashCst() constant public returns (bytes32 b) {
        return blockhash(block.number); 
    }
}
```

**Security Analysis:**
This code contains a bad_randomness vulnerability.

Here’s a concise, accurate and complete summary of why using blockhash(block.number) is a “bad randomness” vulnerability, how it can be attacked, and what to do instead.

1. What the code does (and where it breaks)  
   • Vulnerable pattern: calling  
     blockhash(block.number)  
   • Solidity’s rule: blockhash(n) only returns a real 256-bit hash for blocks in the range (currentBlock – 1) down to (currentBlock – 256).  
   • For any other block number—including the current one—Solidity returns 0x00…00.  

2. Why it’s not random  
   • You cannot know a block’s hash until it has been mined. To avoid undefined or revert behavior, Solidity simply hardcodes blockhash(block.number) = 0.  
   • Any “randomness” derived from that (for example, doing modulo operations on it) collapses to a constant value every time it’s called.  

3. How an attacker abuses it  
   • The attacker inspects your contract code and sees that the “random” seed is always zero.  
   • They compute the outcome off-chain (it’s always the same).  
   • They only call your function when that fixed outcome benefits them—or they never lose, because it never changes.  

4. Preconditions for exploitation  
   • Your contract must trust blockhash(block.number) (or any miner-influenced/undefined on-chain field) as a source of entropy.  
   • The attacker must be able to observe that value or predict it before deciding to interact.  
   • No additional entropy or commit–reveal scheme is used to mask or delay knowledge of the seed.  

5. Correct mitigation strategies  
   • Use a verified external randomness oracle such as Chainlink VRF, which returns on-chain provably fair random numbers.  
   • Implement a commit–reveal scheme in which users commit to a secret value in one transaction and reveal it later, preventing pre-mining prediction.  
   • Combine multiple independent sources of entropy (e.g. user seeds, blockhash of past block, chainlink) and apply a secure hash function.  

Takeaway: blockhash(block.number) is always zero and thus never random. Relying on it for lotteries, games, or any “unpredictable” logic is insecure. Always use battle-tested randomness patterns or oracles.


**Classification**: This code contains a **bad_randomness** vulnerability.
