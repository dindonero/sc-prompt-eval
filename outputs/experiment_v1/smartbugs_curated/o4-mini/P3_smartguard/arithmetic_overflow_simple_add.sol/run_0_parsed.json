    "rendered_prompt": "## SMART CONTRACT SECURITY AUDIT WITH LEARNED EXAMPLES\n\nYou are a security auditor specializing in Solidity smart contracts. Below are examples of vulnerable contracts with detailed security analysis. **Learn from these examples** to analyze the target contract.\n\n---\n\n## IN-CONTEXT LEARNING EXAMPLES\n\nThe following are examples of real vulnerabilities with expert analysis. Study how the vulnerabilities are identified and explained, then apply the same analytical approach to the target contract.\n\n### EXAMPLE 1: ACCESS_CONTROL VULNERABILITY\n\n**Vulnerable Code:**\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\n\ncontract DelegateCaller {\n    uint public n;\n    function delegatecallSetN(address _e, uint _n) public {\n        if (! _e.delegatecall(bytes4(keccak256(\"setN(uint256)\")), _n))\n            revert();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Security Analysis:**\nThis code contains a access_control vulnerability.\n\nHere\u2019s a concise, step-by-step, refined explanation:\n\n1. The risky pattern  \n   \u2022 The function  \n       delegatecallSetN(address _e, uint256 _v)  \n     is declared public\u2014anyone can invoke it.  \n   \u2022 It does  \n       _e.delegatecall(abi.encodeWithSelector(setN.selector, _v));  \n     meaning it will execute code at the supplied address `_e` but in the *storage context* of the calling contract (`DelegateCaller`).  \n\n2. Why this is an access-control issue  \n   \u2022 There is no `onlyOwner` or similar guard on delegatecallSetN\u2014nobody checks who is calling.  \n   \u2022 Because the callee\u2019s code runs with DelegateCaller\u2019s storage layout, a malicious contract can overwrite any storage slot (owner, balances, flags, etc.) or even self-destruct DelegateCaller.  \n   \u2022 In effect, you\u2019ve handed out your private storage keys to anyone who calls this function with an attacker-controlled address.  \n\n3. The attacker\u2019s exploit flow  \n   a. Attacker deploys a malicious contract:  \n       contract Evil {  \n         // Matches the selector setN(uint256)  \n         function setN(uint _ignored) public {  \n           // Overwrite the \"owner\" slot in DelegateCaller  \n           assembly { sstore(0, caller()) }  \n         }  \n       }  \n   b. Attacker calls  \n       delegatecallSetN(evilAddress, 0)  \n   c. DelegateCaller performs a delegatecall into Evil.setN, which stores the attacker\u2019s address into slot 0 (the owner variable), seizing control.  \n\n4. Conditions that make it exploitable  \n   \u2022 delegatecallSetN is public and unprotected.  \n   \u2022 The function accepts an arbitrary target address and blindly delegatecalls into it.  \n   \u2022 delegatecall preserves the caller\u2019s storage context, letting injected code mutate *any* slot.  \n\nSummary  \nBy exposing a public delegatecall to a user-supplied contract, you effectively grant anyone the ability to run arbitrary code against your contract\u2019s storage. That is a classic, severe access-control vulnerability\u2014attackers can seize ownership or corrupt critical state at will.\n\n\n**Classification**: This code contains a **access_control** vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### EXAMPLE 2: DENIAL_OF_SERVICE VULNERABILITY\n\n**Vulnerable Code:**\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\n\ncontract DelegateCaller {\n    uint public n;\n    function delegatecallSetN(address _e, uint _n) public {\n        if (! _e.delegatecall(bytes4(keccak256(\"setN(uint256)\")), _n))\n            revert();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Security Analysis:**\nThis code contains a denial_of_service vulnerability.\n\nHere\u2019s a concise, accurate and complete explanation of the vulnerability, how an attacker exploits it, and the conditions that enable the DoS:\n\n1. Vulnerable pattern in the code  \n   \u2022 Function delegatecallSetN(address _e, uint256 _n) lets *any* caller supply the address `_e`.  \n   \u2022 It then does  \n     delegatecall(bytes4(keccak256(\"setN(uint256)\")), _n)  \n     and immediately reverts if that delegatecall returns false.  \n   \u2022 In effect, you\u2019re delegating execution (and storage access) to a user\u2010supplied contract and declaring \u201cany failure = full revert.\u201d\n\n2. Attack vector  \n   \u2022 Attacker deploys a malicious contract `Evil` with a setN signature:  \n     function setN(uint256) public returns (bool) { revert(); }  \n     (or simply never returns true).  \n   \u2022 Attacker calls delegatecallSetN(evilAddress, someValue).  \n   \u2022 The delegatecall into `Evil.setN` either reverts or returns false.  \n   \u2022 delegatecallSetN sees the failure and immediately reverts.  \n   \u2022 Once `Evil` is known, *every* subsequent call to delegatecallSetN(evilAddress, \u2026) will revert, blocking legitimate usage.\n\n3. Enabling conditions for permanent DoS  \n   \u2022 You allow callers to choose the delegatecall target address.  \n   \u2022 You interpret *any* delegatecall failure as a trigger to revert, with no fallback or alternative path.  \n   \u2022 Delegatecall runs in your contract\u2019s context\u2014so the malicious contract can consume all gas or explicitly revert.  \n   \u2022 There\u2019s no rate\u2010limit, no whitelisting, and no recovery mechanism, so the attacker can repeat this forever.\n\nKey takeaway: Never delegatecall into a user\u2010controlled address with a hard revert on failure. At minimum, restrict the set of allowed target addresses or handle failures gracefully (e.g. return an error code instead of reverting).\n\n\n**Classification**: This code contains a **denial_of_service** vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### EXAMPLE 3: BAD_RANDOMNESS VULNERABILITY\n\n**Vulnerable Code:**\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\n\ncontract blockHashNotReturned {\n    function currentBlockHash() public returns (bytes32 b) {\n        return blockhash(block.number); \n    }\n    function currentBlockHashCst() constant public returns (bytes32 b) {\n        return blockhash(block.number); \n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Security Analysis:**\nThis code contains a bad_randomness vulnerability.\n\nHere\u2019s a concise, accurate and complete summary of why using blockhash(block.number) is a \u201cbad randomness\u201d vulnerability, how it can be attacked, and what to do instead.\n\n1. What the code does (and where it breaks)  \n   \u2022 Vulnerable pattern: calling  \n     blockhash(block.number)  \n   \u2022 Solidity\u2019s rule: blockhash(n) only returns a real 256-bit hash for blocks in the range (currentBlock \u2013 1) down to (currentBlock \u2013 256).  \n   \u2022 For any other block number\u2014including the current one\u2014Solidity returns 0x00\u202600.  \n\n2. Why it\u2019s not random  \n   \u2022 You cannot know a block\u2019s hash until it has been mined. To avoid undefined or revert behavior, Solidity simply hardcodes blockhash(block.number) = 0.  \n   \u2022 Any \u201crandomness\u201d derived from that (for example, doing modulo operations on it) collapses to a constant value every time it\u2019s called.  \n\n3. How an attacker abuses it  \n   \u2022 The attacker inspects your contract code and sees that the \u201crandom\u201d seed is always zero.  \n   \u2022 They compute the outcome off-chain (it\u2019s always the same).  \n   \u2022 They only call your function when that fixed outcome benefits them\u2014or they never lose, because it never changes.  \n\n4. Preconditions for exploitation  \n   \u2022 Your contract must trust blockhash(block.number) (or any miner-influenced/undefined on-chain field) as a source of entropy.  \n   \u2022 The attacker must be able to observe that value or predict it before deciding to interact.  \n   \u2022 No additional entropy or commit\u2013reveal scheme is used to mask or delay knowledge of the seed.  \n\n5. Correct mitigation strategies  \n   \u2022 Use a verified external randomness oracle such as Chainlink VRF, which returns on-chain provably fair random numbers.  \n   \u2022 Implement a commit\u2013reveal scheme in which users commit to a secret value in one transaction and reveal it later, preventing pre-mining prediction.  \n   \u2022 Combine multiple independent sources of entropy (e.g. user seeds, blockhash of past block, chainlink) and apply a secure hash function.  \n\nTakeaway: blockhash(block.number) is always zero and thus never random. Relying on it for lotteries, games, or any \u201cunpredictable\u201d logic is insecure. Always use battle-tested randomness patterns or oracles.\n\n\n**Classification**: This code contains a **bad_randomness** vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### EXAMPLE 4: ARITHMETIC VULNERABILITY\n\n**Vulnerable Code:**\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\n\ncontract cryptocurrencyClubTest {\n    \n    uint originalTime;\n    \n    constructor() public{\n        originalTime = now;\n    }\n    \n    \n    \n    function BirthdayBoyClickHere() public view returns(string) {\n        require(now < originalTime + 23 hours);\n        return \"Happy Birthday Harrison! I know this contract is noobish but I will get better.\";\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\n**Security Analysis:**\nThis code contains a arithmetic vulnerability.\n\nI\u2019d love to give you a precise, polished write-up\u2014but I\u2019m flying a bit blind without seeing the actual contract. To be sure my explanation:\n\n 1. accurately pinpoints the vulnerable lines  \n 2. clearly walks through exactly how an attacker could take advantage  \n 3. fully enumerates every precondition (block number, token balance, role assignment, etc.)  \n\nI\u2019ll need the Solidity (or Vyper) code you want me to review. Could you please paste in:\n\n \u2022 The contract (or the relevant functions and state variables)  \n \u2022 Any inherited contracts or interfaces that define access controls  \n \u2022 How you\u2019re invoking or testing the vulnerable function  \n\nOnce I have that, I can re-audit:\n\n \u2013 Externally-called functions (reentrancy, missing modifiers)  \n \u2013 Permissions checks (onlyOwner/onlyRole, unguarded paths)  \n \u2013 Integer math (under/overflows, safe-math omissions)  \n \u2013 Return-value checks on ERC20/ERC721 calls  \n \u2013 Block or timestamp\u2013based logic (time locks, cooldowns)  \n\nand then deliver a final, bullet-proof explanation of the issue, the exact attack flow, and how to mitigate it.\n\n\n**Classification**: This code contains a **arithmetic** vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### EXAMPLE 5: UNCHECKED_LOW_LEVEL_CALLS VULNERABILITY\n\n**Vulnerable Code:**\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.4.8;\ncontract Victim {\n   \n  mapping(address => uint) public balances;\n   \n  function withdraw(uint _amount) public {\n    if(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount) {\n        if(msg.sender.call.value(_amount)()) {\n            _amount;\n        }\n        balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;\n    }\n  }\n  function deposit() payable {}\n}\n\n```\n\n**Security Analysis:**\nThis code contains a unchecked_low_level_calls vulnerability.\n\nYes\u2014your write-up correctly pinpoints the bug, clearly lays out both DoS and re-entrancy attacks, and lists the enabling conditions. Below is a concise, final explanation.\n\n1. Vulnerable Code Pattern  \n   \u2022 Uses a low-level call that forwards all gas and returns only a boolean:  \n     ```solidity\n     if (msg.sender.call.value(_amount)()) {\n       // no-op\n     }\n     balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;\n     ```  \n   \u2022 Problems:  \n     \u2013 You never revert if the call fails (you ignore the false case).  \n     \u2013 You perform the external call *before* updating the user\u2019s balance.\n\n2. Exploit Scenarios  \n   A) DoS by Reverting Fallback  \n     \u2013 Attacker\u2019s fallback always reverts.  \n     \u2013 call.value(...)() returns false, but the contract doesn\u2019t revert.  \n     \u2013 It still deducts the attacker\u2019s balance\u2014funds are burned or locked\u2014and may break further withdrawals.  \n   B) Classic Re-entrancy  \n     \u2013 On a successful call, attacker\u2019s fallback re-enters `withdraw` before their balance is decremented.  \n     \u2013 They withdraw again and again, emptying the contract.\n\n3. Conditions That Enable the Attack  \n   \u2013 Use of `.call.value(...)()` instead of `.transfer`/`.send`.  \n   \u2013 Failure to check and revert on the boolean result of the low-level call.  \n   \u2013 External call happening *before* state changes (violates Checks-Effects-Interactions).  \n   \u2013 No re-entrancy guard in place.\n\n4. How to Fix  \n   \u2013 Prefer `msg.sender.transfer(_amount);` (auto-reverts on failure, limited gas).  \n   \u2013 Or at minimum:  \n     ```solidity\n     require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);\n     balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;                // Effects first\n     require(msg.sender.call.value(_amount)());      // Interaction last\n     ```  \n   \u2013 Add a re-entrancy guard (e.g. OpenZeppelin\u2019s `ReentrancyGuard`) if you must use low-level calls.\n\nBy checking and reverting on failures, updating state before external calls, and/or using bounded-gas transfer methods, you eliminate both the DoS\u2010by\u2010revert and the re-entrancy drain.\n\n\n**Classification**: This code contains a **unchecked_low_level_calls** vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n\n## TARGET CONTRACT FOR ANALYSIS\n\nNow apply the same analytical approach demonstrated above to this contract:\n\n```solidity\n/*\n \n * @author: -\n \n */\n\npragma solidity 0.4.25;\n\ncontract Overflow_Add {\n    uint public balance = 1;\n\n    function add(uint256 deposit) public {\n        \n        balance += deposit;\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n---\n\n## YOUR ANALYSIS\n\nFollowing the pattern shown in the examples:\n\n### 1.
