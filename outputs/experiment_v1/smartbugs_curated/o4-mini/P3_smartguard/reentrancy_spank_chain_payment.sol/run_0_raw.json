If *any* call in the list reverts or simply runs out of gas, the entire execution aborts and reverts.  \n\u2022 A malicious submitter who wins can slip in:  \n  \u2013 A call that always reverts (e.g. `require(false)`)  \n  \u2013 A contract that self-destructs or loops until gas runs out  \n\u2022 Once the arbitrator picks that list, everyone\u2019s session is stuck: no partial execution, no recovery path, deposits may be locked, future sessions may be blocked.  \n\nAttack conditions for DoS  \n\u2013 The attacker again needs to win the dispute and have their list selected.  \n\u2013 They include at least one \u201cpoison pill\u201d transaction that always reverts or burns excessive gas.  \n\u2013 On execution, the entire call stack unwinds, the session never completes, and funds remain locked.  \n\nOther notes  \n\u2013 Unbounded arrays of submissions or rounds can also lead to uncallable loops (e.g. in `withdrawFees`), compounding denial-of-service risk.  \n\u2013 Reliance on `block.timestamp` for submission windows can be manipulated by miners\u2014but this is a lower-severity concern compared to reentrancy and outright DoS.  \n\nOverall verdict  \nThe governor\u2019s pattern of looping over an untrusted list of low-level calls without any reentrancy lock or per-call protection is fundamentally unsafe. An attacker who wins a dispute can either reenter to subvert contract state or halt execution entirely.  \n\nRecommendations  \n\u2022 Add a `nonReentrant` modifier (or equivalent mutex) around the entire `executeSession` (or whatever function runs the winning list).  \n\u2022 Consider executing each call in its own try/catch so that a single revert cannot kill the entire batch\u2014optionally skipping or refunding only the failed call.  \n\u2022 Cap the maximum length of the list or maximum gas per individual call to prevent unbounded gas consumption.\n\n\n**Classification**: This code contains a **reentrancy** vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### EXAMPLE 2: UNCHECKED_LOW_LEVEL_CALLS VULNERABILITY\n\n**Vulnerable Code:**\n```solidity\n/**\n *\n *\n *\n *\n *\n *\n */\n\n/* solium-disable security/no-block-members */\n/* solium-disable max-len */\n/* solium-disable security/no-send */\n\npragma solidity ^0.4.26;\n\nimport \"@kleros/kleros-interaction/contracts/standard/arbitration/Arbitrable.sol\";\nimport \"@kleros/kleros-interaction/contracts/libraries/CappedMath.sol\";\n\n/**\n *  Note that this contract trusts that the Arbitrator is honest and will not re-enter or modify its costs during a call.\n *  Also note that tx.origin should not matter in contracts called by the governor.\n */\ncontract KlerosGovernor is Arbitrable {\n    using CappedMath for uint;\n\n    /* *** Contract variables *** */\n    enum Status { NoDispute, DisputeCreated, Resolved }\n\n    struct Session {\n        Round[] rounds; // Tracks each appeal round of the dispute in the session in the form rounds[appeal].\n        uint ruling; // The ruling that was given in this session, if any.\n        uint disputeID; // ID given to the dispute of the session, if any.\n        uint[] submittedLists; // Tracks all lists that were submitted in a session in the form submittedLists[submissionID].\n        uint sumDeposit; // Sum of all submission deposits in a session (minus arbitration fees).

Below is a concise, refined explanation:\n\n1. Vulnerable Pattern  \n   \u2022 You have a Transaction struct holding  \n     \u2013 address target  \n     \u2013 uint    value  \n     \u2013 bytes  data  \n   \u2022 To execute, the logic does something like:  \n     ```solidity\n     target.call.value(value)(data);\n     submission.txs[i].executed = true;\n     ```  \n   \u2022 No `require` (or `if (!success) revert()`), so the boolean return from `.call` is ignored.\n\n2. Why This Is Dangerous  \n   \u2022 If `target` is a malicious contract that simply reverts, the low-level call returns `false` but the revert is *silently* swallowed.  \n   \u2022 Right after you mark that tx as executed \u2013 even though it never ran \u2013 corrupting your internal state.\n\n3. Exploit Scenario (Denial-of-Service)  \n   \u2022 Attacker submits a proposal containing:  \n     \u2013 `target` = address of their contract  \n     \u2013 `data`   = calldata that immediately reverts  \n   \u2022 Governor approves the proposal.  \n   \u2022 During execution, `.call` fails but you still flag it as done.  \n   \u2022 That step can no longer be retried or skipped, so the entire execution queue is stuck forever.\n\n4. Conditions Required for the Attack  \n   \u2022 Users can propose arbitrary `target` and `data`.  \n   \u2022 Execution uses unchecked low-level calls (`.call`, `.delegatecall`, etc.).  \n   \u2022 State is advanced unconditionally after the call, regardless of success.\n\nKey Takeaway  \nAlways check the boolean result of any low-level call. Better yet, use well-audited utility functions (e.g. OpenZeppelin\u2019s Address.functionCall) which revert on failure. Unchecked calls let malicious contracts force silent failures, corrupt internal state, and mount permanent denial-of-service.\n\n\n**Classification**: This code contains a **unchecked_low_level_calls** vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### EXAMPLE 3: REENTRANCY VULNERABILITY\n\n**Vulnerable Code:**\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\npragma solidity ^0.8.1;\n\n/*\n *\n * sender of the transaction and its data.

Here\u2019s a tightened summary:\n\n1. Vulnerable pattern  \n   \u2022 You do an external call that forwards all remaining gas (e.g. Address.sendValue or recipient.call{value: amount}(\"\"))  \n   \u2022 You perform that call before updating your own state (you send ETH first, then decrement the user\u2019s balance)\n\n2. Attack vector  \n   1) Attacker calls withdraw(amount).  \n   2) require(balances[attacker] \u2265 amount) passes.  \n   3) Address.sendValue forwards all gas and triggers attacker\u2019s fallback/receive.  \n   4) In fallback, attacker re-calls withdraw(amount) *before* your contract has reduced balances[attacker].  \n   5) Your contract again sees the full balance, sends ETH again, and only then finally updates balances[attacker].  \n   6) Loop repeats until your contract is drained.\n\n3. Conditions for exploitation  \n   \u2022 You forward *all* gas, giving the callee enough budget to reenter.  \n   \u2022 You update state *after* the external call (interaction \u2192 effect).  \n   \u2022 No mutex or reentrancy guard is in place.\n\n4. Defenses  \n   \u2022 Follow Checks-Effects-Interactions:  \n     1) Check balances and permissions  \n     2) **Effect:** deduct the balance  \n     3) **Interaction:** then send ETH  \n   \u2022 Or deploy a ReentrancyGuard to block nested calls.  \n   \u2022 (Less preferred) Limit forwarded gas (e.g. transfer or a low-gas call).\n\nBy sending ETH with an unrestricted call before you lower the sender\u2019s balance, you give an attacker the exact window they need to reenter and drain funds far beyond their entitlement. That sequence\u2014forward all gas + interaction before effect\u2014*is* the classic reentrancy hole.\n\n\n**Classification**: This code contains a **reentrancy** vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### EXAMPLE 4: UNCHECKED_LOW_LEVEL_CALLS VULNERABILITY\n\n**Vulnerable Code:**\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\npragma solidity ^0.8.1;\n\n/*\n *\n * sender of the transaction and its data.

Always bubble up or handle the success flag.\n\n\n**Classification**: This code contains a **unchecked_low_level_calls** vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### EXAMPLE 5: REENTRANCY VULNERABILITY\n\n**Vulnerable Code:**\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.4.17;\n\n/*\n\nICO Syndicate Contract\n========================\n\nBuys ICO Tokens for a given ICO known contract address\nAuthor: Bogdan\n\n*/\n\n// ERC20 Interface: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20\ncontract ERC20 {\n    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);\n    function balanceOf(address _owner) public constant returns (uint256 balance);\n}\n\ncontract ICOSyndicate {\n    // Store the amount of ETH deposited by each account.\n    mapping (address => uint256) public balances;\n    // Track whether the contract has bought the tokens yet.\n    bool public bought_tokens;\n    // Record ETH value of tokens currently held by contract.\n    uint256 public contract_eth_value;\n    // Emergency kill switch in case a critical bug is found.\n    bool public kill_switch;\n\n    // Maximum amount of user ETH contract will accept.

What the contract does (simplified)  \n   \u2022 function withdraw(address user) public {  \n       \u2013 Read total tokens in the syndicate (`token.balanceOf(this)`)  \n       \u2013 Compute `tokens_to_pay = balances[user] * total_tokens / contract_eth_value`  \n       \u2013 Subtract `balances[user]` from `contract_eth_value` and zero out `balances[user]`  \n       \u2013 Call `token.transfer(user, tokens_to_pay)`  \n     }\n\n2. Why it looks \u201csafe\u201d at first glance  \n   \u2022 It uses Checks\u2013Effects\u2013Interactions for the *current* user:  \n     \u2013 Checks: computes the payout  \n     \u2013 Effects: zeroes out that user\u2019s balance  \n     \u2013 Interaction: calls out to the ERC-20 token\n\n3. The critical oversight  \n   \u2022 You pass in an arbitrary `user` address rather than forcing `msg.sender`  \n   \u2022 You call an **untrusted** token contract in the middle of your logic  \n   \u2022 If that token\u2019s `transfer` re-enters your syndicate, it can call `withdraw(otherVictim)`\n\n4. How the attack works step by step  \n   1. Attacker deploys a malicious ERC-20 whose `transfer(...)` does:  \n        \u2013 normal transfer bookkeeping  \n        \u2013 then `ICOSyndicate(msg.sender).withdraw(victim)`  \n   2. Honest state is: `balances[A]=10, balances[B]=10, contract_eth_value=20`  \n   3. Attacker calls `withdraw(A)`. Syndicate zeroes out `balances[A]`, drops `contract_eth_value` to 10, then calls `token.transfer(A, attackerTokens)`.  \n   4. Inside the malicious token\u2019s `transfer`, execution re-enters `ICOSyndicate.withdraw(B)`. Now:  \n        \u2013 `balances[B]` is still 10  \n        \u2013 `contract_eth_value` is 10  \n        \u2013 Therefore `tokens_to_pay` for B = 10 * (10 tokens left) / 10 = **all remaining tokens**  \n   5. Attacker drains B\u2019s share in that one transaction.\n\n5. Conditions that make it possible  \n   \u2022 `withdraw(address user)` is public and lets you specify *any* user  \n   \u2022 The external call is to an untrusted token contract that can re-enter  \n   \u2022 There is no reentrancy guard\n\n6. How to fix it (pick one or more)  \n   \u2022 Restrict withdrawals so you can only pull your own balance:  \n     `function withdraw() public { withdrawInternal(msg.sender); }`  \n   \u2022 Add a non-reentrant modifier around the whole withdraw logic  \n   \u2022 Eliminate any external calls before all user state is *completely* settled\n\nIn summary, although you zero out the *immediate* user\u2019s balance before calling `transfer`, you leave *other* users\u2019 balances intact\u2014and because you let a malicious token re-enter with a different `user` param, they can drain everyone else in the same transaction. That is a textbook re-entrancy vulnerability.\n\n\n**Classification**: This code contains a **reentrancy** vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n\n## TARGET CONTRACT FOR ANALYSIS\n\nNow apply the same analytical approach demonstrated above to this contract:\n\n```solidity\n/*\n * @source: https://github.com/trailofbits/not-so-smart-contracts/blob/master/reentrancy/SpankChain_source_code/SpankChain_Payment.sol\n * @author: -\n \n */\n\n // https://etherscan.io/address/0xf91546835f756da0c10cfa0cda95b15577b84aa7#code\n\n pragma solidity ^0.4.23;\n // produced by the Solididy File Flattener (c) David Appleton 2018\n // contact : dave@akomba.com\n // released under Apache 2.0 licence\n contract Token {\n     /* This is a slight change to the ERC20 base standard.\n     function totalSupply() constant returns (uint256 supply);\n     is replaced with:\n     uint256 public totalSupply;\n     This automatically creates a getter function for the totalSupply.\n     This is moved to the base contract since public getter functions are not\n     currently recognised as an implementation of the matching abstract\n     function by the compiler.\n     */\n     /// total amount of tokens\n     uint256 public totalSupply;\n\n     /// @param _owner The address from which the balance will be retrieved\n     /// @return The balance\n     function balanceOf(address _owner) public constant returns (uint256 balance);\n\n     /// @notice send `_value` token to `_to` from `msg.sender`\n     /// @param _to The address of the recipient\n     /// @param _value The amount of token to be transferred\n     /// @return Whether the transfer was successful or not\n     function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);\n\n     /// @notice send `_value` token to `_to` from `_from` on the condition it is approved by `_from`\n     /// @param _from The address of the sender\n     /// @param _to The address of the recipient\n     /// @param _value The amount of token to be transferred\n     /// @return Whether the transfer was successful or not\n     function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);\n\n     /// @notice `msg.sender` approves `_spender` to spend `_value` tokens\n     /// @param _spender The address of the account able to transfer the tokens\n     /// @param _value The amount of tokens to be approved for transfer\n     /// @return Whether the approval was successful or not\n     function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);\n\n     /// @param _owner The address of the account owning tokens\n     /// @param _spender The address of the account able to transfer the tokens\n     /// @return Amount of remaining tokens allowed to spent\n     function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public constant returns (uint256 remaining);\n\n     event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value);\n     event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value);\n }\n\n library ECTools {\n\n     // @dev Recovers the address which has signed a message\n     // @thanks https://gist.github.com/axic/5b33912c6f61ae6fd96d6c4a47afde6d\n     function recoverSigner(bytes32 _hashedMsg, string _sig) public pure returns (address) {\n         require(_hashedMsg != 0x00);\n\n         // need this for test RPC\n         bytes memory prefix = \"\\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\\n32\";\n         bytes32 prefixedHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(prefix, _hashedMsg));\n\n         if (bytes(_sig).length != 132) {\n             return 0x0;\n         }\n         bytes32 r;\n         bytes32 s;\n         uint8 v;\n         bytes memory sig = hexstrToBytes(substring(_sig, 2, 132));\n         assembly {\n             r := mload(add(sig, 32))\n             s := mload(add(sig, 64))\n             v := byte(0, mload(add(sig, 96)))\n         }\n         if (v < 27) {\n             v += 27;\n         }\n         if (v < 27 || v > 28) {\n             return 0x0;\n         }\n         return ecrecover(prefixedHash, v, r, s);\n     }\n\n     // @dev Verifies if the message is signed by an address\n     function isSignedBy(bytes32 _hashedMsg, string _sig, address _addr) public pure returns (bool) {\n         require(_addr != 0x0);\n\n         return _addr == recoverSigner(_hashedMsg, _sig);\n     }\n\n     // @dev Converts an hexstring to bytes\n     function hexstrToBytes(string _hexstr) public pure returns (bytes) {\n         uint len = bytes(_hexstr).length;\n         require(len % 2 == 0);\n\n         bytes memory bstr = bytes(new string(len / 2));\n         uint k = 0;\n         string memory s;\n         string memory r;\n         for (uint i = 0;

ANALYSIS\n\nFollowing the pattern shown in the examples:\n\n### 1. Contract Overview\n- What is this contract's purpose?\n- What assets does it manage?\n- Who are the intended users?\n\n### 2. Function-by-Function Security Analysis\nFor each function, analyze:\n- Access control: Who can call it?\n- State changes: What is modified?\n- External interactions: Any calls to other contracts?\n- Trust assumptions: What must be true for safety?\n\n### 3. Vulnerability Pattern Matching\nCompare the target contract to each example above:\n- Does it have patterns similar to Example 1 (reentrancy)?\n- Does it have patterns similar to Example 2 (unchecked_low_level_calls)?\n- Does it have patterns similar to Example 3 (reentrancy)?\n- Does it have patterns similar to Example 4 (unchecked_low_level_calls)?\n- Does it have patterns similar to Example 5 (reentrancy)?\n\n### 4. Evidence Documentation\nFor any vulnerability found:\n- Identify exact line numbers\n- Identify the vulnerable function\n- Describe a concrete attack scenario\n- Explain how the vulnerability could be exploited\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\nProvide your findings as a JSON array. Include ONLY vulnerabilities you have high confidence in, with concrete evidence:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"category\": \"DASP category (reentrancy, access_control, arithmetic, unchecked_low_level_calls, denial_of_service, bad_randomness, front_running, time_manipulation, short_addresses, other)\",\n    \"title\": \"Descriptive vulnerability title\",\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"file\": \"contract.sol\",\n      \"lines\": [line_numbers_where_vulnerability_exists],\n      \"function\": \"vulnerable_function_name\"\n    },\n    \"explanation\": \"Clear explanation of the vulnerability and how an attacker could exploit it\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nReturn `[]` if no vulnerabilities are found after thorough analysis.\n\n---\n\nAnalyze the target contract using the methodology demonstrated in the examples above. Be thorough but precise - only report vulnerabilities you can clearly demonstrate with evidence.",

If *any* call in the list reverts or simply runs out of gas, the entire execution aborts and reverts.  \n\u2022 A malicious submitter who wins can slip in:  \n  \u2013 A call that always reverts (e.g. `require(false)`)  \n  \u2013 A contract that self-destructs or loops until gas runs out  \n\u2022 Once the arbitrator picks that list, everyone\u2019s session is stuck: no partial execution, no recovery path, deposits may be locked, future sessions may be blocked.  \n\nAttack conditions for DoS  \n\u2013 The attacker again needs to win the dispute and have their list selected.  \n\u2013 They include at least one \u201cpoison pill\u201d transaction that always reverts or burns excessive gas.  \n\u2013 On execution, the entire call stack unwinds, the session never completes, and funds remain locked.  \n\nOther notes  \n\u2013 Unbounded arrays of submissions or rounds can also lead to uncallable loops (e.g. in `withdrawFees`), compounding denial-of-service risk.  \n\u2013 Reliance on `block.timestamp` for submission windows can be manipulated by miners\u2014but this is a lower-severity concern compared to reentrancy and outright DoS.  \n\nOverall verdict  \nThe governor\u2019s pattern of looping over an untrusted list of low-level calls without any reentrancy lock or per-call protection is fundamentally unsafe. An attacker who wins a dispute can either reenter to subvert contract state or halt execution entirely.  \n\nRecommendations  \n\u2022 Add a `nonReentrant` modifier (or equivalent mutex) around the entire `executeSession` (or whatever function runs the winning list).  \n\u2022 Consider executing each call in its own try/catch so that a single revert cannot kill the entire batch\u2014optionally skipping or refunding only the failed call.  \n\u2022 Cap the maximum length of the list or maximum gas per individual call to prevent unbounded gas consumption.\n\n\n**Classification**: This code contains a **reentrancy** vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### EXAMPLE 2: UNCHECKED_LOW_LEVEL_CALLS VULNERABILITY\n\n**Vulnerable Code:**\n```solidity\n/**\n *\n *\n *\n *\n *\n *\n */\n\n/* solium-disable security/no-block-members */\n/* solium-disable max-len */\n/* solium-disable security/no-send */\n\npragma solidity ^0.4.26;\n\nimport \"@kleros/kleros-interaction/contracts/standard/arbitration/Arbitrable.sol\";\nimport \"@kleros/kleros-interaction/contracts/libraries/CappedMath.sol\";\n\n/**\n *  Note that this contract trusts that the Arbitrator is honest and will not re-enter or modify its costs during a call.\n *  Also note that tx.origin should not matter in contracts called by the governor.\n */\ncontract KlerosGovernor is Arbitrable {\n    using CappedMath for uint;\n\n    /* *** Contract variables *** */\n    enum Status { NoDispute, DisputeCreated, Resolved }\n\n    struct Session {\n        Round[] rounds; // Tracks each appeal round of the dispute in the session in the form rounds[appeal].\n        uint ruling; // The ruling that was given in this session, if any.\n        uint disputeID; // ID given to the dispute of the session, if any.\n        uint[] submittedLists; // Tracks all lists that were submitted in a session in the form submittedLists[submissionID].\n        uint sumDeposit; // Sum of all submission deposits in a session (minus arbitration fees).

Below is a concise, refined explanation:\n\n1. Vulnerable Pattern  \n   \u2022 You have a Transaction struct holding  \n     \u2013 address target  \n     \u2013 uint    value  \n     \u2013 bytes  data  \n   \u2022 To execute, the logic does something like:  \n     ```solidity\n     target.call.value(value)(data);\n     submission.txs[i].executed = true;\n     ```  \n   \u2022 No `require` (or `if (!success) revert()`), so the boolean return from `.call` is ignored.\n\n2. Why This Is Dangerous  \n   \u2022 If `target` is a malicious contract that simply reverts, the low-level call returns `false` but the revert is *silently* swallowed.  \n   \u2022 Right after you mark that tx as executed \u2013 even though it never ran \u2013 corrupting your internal state.\n\n3. Exploit Scenario (Denial-of-Service)  \n   \u2022 Attacker submits a proposal containing:  \n     \u2013 `target` = address of their contract  \n     \u2013 `data`   = calldata that immediately reverts  \n   \u2022 Governor approves the proposal.  \n   \u2022 During execution, `.call` fails but you still flag it as done.  \n   \u2022 That step can no longer be retried or skipped, so the entire execution queue is stuck forever.\n\n4. Conditions Required for the Attack  \n   \u2022 Users can propose arbitrary `target` and `data`.  \n   \u2022 Execution uses unchecked low-level calls (`.call`, `.delegatecall`, etc.).  \n   \u2022 State is advanced unconditionally after the call, regardless of success.\n\nKey Takeaway  \nAlways check the boolean result of any low-level call. Better yet, use well-audited utility functions (e.g. OpenZeppelin\u2019s Address.functionCall) which revert on failure. Unchecked calls let malicious contracts force silent failures, corrupt internal state, and mount permanent denial-of-service.\n\n\n**Classification**: This code contains a **unchecked_low_level_calls** vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### EXAMPLE 3: REENTRANCY VULNERABILITY\n\n**Vulnerable Code:**\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\npragma solidity ^0.8.1;\n\n/*\n *\n * sender of the transaction and its data.

Here\u2019s a tightened summary:\n\n1. Vulnerable pattern  \n   \u2022 You do an external call that forwards all remaining gas (e.g. Address.sendValue or recipient.call{value: amount}(\"\"))  \n   \u2022 You perform that call before updating your own state (you send ETH first, then decrement the user\u2019s balance)\n\n2. Attack vector  \n   1) Attacker calls withdraw(amount).  \n   2) require(balances[attacker] \u2265 amount) passes.  \n   3) Address.sendValue forwards all gas and triggers attacker\u2019s fallback/receive.  \n   4) In fallback, attacker re-calls withdraw(amount) *before* your contract has reduced balances[attacker].  \n   5) Your contract again sees the full balance, sends ETH again, and only then finally updates balances[attacker].  \n   6) Loop repeats until your contract is drained.\n\n3. Conditions for exploitation  \n   \u2022 You forward *all* gas, giving the callee enough budget to reenter.  \n   \u2022 You update state *after* the external call (interaction \u2192 effect).  \n   \u2022 No mutex or reentrancy guard is in place.\n\n4. Defenses  \n   \u2022 Follow Checks-Effects-Interactions:  \n     1) Check balances and permissions  \n     2) **Effect:** deduct the balance  \n     3) **Interaction:** then send ETH  \n   \u2022 Or deploy a ReentrancyGuard to block nested calls.  \n   \u2022 (Less preferred) Limit forwarded gas (e.g. transfer or a low-gas call).\n\nBy sending ETH with an unrestricted call before you lower the sender\u2019s balance, you give an attacker the exact window they need to reenter and drain funds far beyond their entitlement. That sequence\u2014forward all gas + interaction before effect\u2014*is* the classic reentrancy hole.\n\n\n**Classification**: This code contains a **reentrancy** vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### EXAMPLE 4: UNCHECKED_LOW_LEVEL_CALLS VULNERABILITY\n\n**Vulnerable Code:**\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\npragma solidity ^0.8.1;\n\n/*\n *\n * sender of the transaction and its data.

Always bubble up or handle the success flag.\n\n\n**Classification**: This code contains a **unchecked_low_level_calls** vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### EXAMPLE 5: REENTRANCY VULNERABILITY\n\n**Vulnerable Code:**\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.4.17;\n\n/*\n\nICO Syndicate Contract\n========================\n\nBuys ICO Tokens for a given ICO known contract address\nAuthor: Bogdan\n\n*/\n\n// ERC20 Interface: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20\ncontract ERC20 {\n    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);\n    function balanceOf(address _owner) public constant returns (uint256 balance);\n}\n\ncontract ICOSyndicate {\n    // Store the amount of ETH deposited by each account.\n    mapping (address => uint256) public balances;\n    // Track whether the contract has bought the tokens yet.\n    bool public bought_tokens;\n    // Record ETH value of tokens currently held by contract.\n    uint256 public contract_eth_value;\n    // Emergency kill switch in case a critical bug is found.\n    bool public kill_switch;\n\n    // Maximum amount of user ETH contract will accept.

What the contract does (simplified)  \n   \u2022 function withdraw(address user) public {  \n       \u2013 Read total tokens in the syndicate (`token.balanceOf(this)`)  \n       \u2013 Compute `tokens_to_pay = balances[user] * total_tokens / contract_eth_value`  \n       \u2013 Subtract `balances[user]` from `contract_eth_value` and zero out `balances[user]`  \n       \u2013 Call `token.transfer(user, tokens_to_pay)`  \n     }\n\n2. Why it looks \u201csafe\u201d at first glance  \n   \u2022 It uses Checks\u2013Effects\u2013Interactions for the *current* user:  \n     \u2013 Checks: computes the payout  \n     \u2013 Effects: zeroes out that user\u2019s balance  \n     \u2013 Interaction: calls out to the ERC-20 token\n\n3. The critical oversight  \n   \u2022 You pass in an arbitrary `user` address rather than forcing `msg.sender`  \n   \u2022 You call an **untrusted** token contract in the middle of your logic  \n   \u2022 If that token\u2019s `transfer` re-enters your syndicate, it can call `withdraw(otherVictim)`\n\n4. How the attack works step by step  \n   1. Attacker deploys a malicious ERC-20 whose `transfer(...)` does:  \n        \u2013 normal transfer bookkeeping  \n        \u2013 then `ICOSyndicate(msg.sender).withdraw(victim)`  \n   2. Honest state is: `balances[A]=10, balances[B]=10, contract_eth_value=20`  \n   3. Attacker calls `withdraw(A)`. Syndicate zeroes out `balances[A]`, drops `contract_eth_value` to 10, then calls `token.transfer(A, attackerTokens)`.  \n   4. Inside the malicious token\u2019s `transfer`, execution re-enters `ICOSyndicate.withdraw(B)`. Now:  \n        \u2013 `balances[B]` is still 10  \n        \u2013 `contract_eth_value` is 10  \n        \u2013 Therefore `tokens_to_pay` for B = 10 * (10 tokens left) / 10 = **all remaining tokens**  \n   5. Attacker drains B\u2019s share in that one transaction.\n\n5. Conditions that make it possible  \n   \u2022 `withdraw(address user)` is public and lets you specify *any* user  \n   \u2022 The external call is to an untrusted token contract that can re-enter  \n   \u2022 There is no reentrancy guard\n\n6. How to fix it (pick one or more)  \n   \u2022 Restrict withdrawals so you can only pull your own balance:  \n     `function withdraw() public { withdrawInternal(msg.sender); }`  \n   \u2022 Add a non-reentrant modifier around the whole withdraw logic  \n   \u2022 Eliminate any external calls before all user state is *completely* settled\n\nIn summary, although you zero out the *immediate* user\u2019s balance before calling `transfer`, you leave *other* users\u2019 balances intact\u2014and because you let a malicious token re-enter with a different `user` param, they can drain everyone else in the same transaction. That is a textbook re-entrancy vulnerability.\n\n\n**Classification**: This code contains a **reentrancy** vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n\n## TARGET CONTRACT FOR ANALYSIS\n\nNow apply the same analytical approach demonstrated above to this contract:\n\n```solidity\n/*\n * @source: https://github.com/trailofbits/not-so-smart-contracts/blob/master/reentrancy/SpankChain_source_code/SpankChain_Payment.sol\n * @author: -\n \n */\n\n // https://etherscan.io/address/0xf91546835f756da0c10cfa0cda95b15577b84aa7#code\n\n pragma solidity ^0.4.23;\n // produced by the Solididy File Flattener (c) David Appleton 2018\n // contact : dave@akomba.com\n // released under Apache 2.0 licence\n contract Token {\n     /* This is a slight change to the ERC20 base standard.\n     function totalSupply() constant returns (uint256 supply);\n     is replaced with:\n     uint256 public totalSupply;\n     This automatically creates a getter function for the totalSupply.\n     This is moved to the base contract since public getter functions are not\n     currently recognised as an implementation of the matching abstract\n     function by the compiler.\n     */\n     /// total amount of tokens\n     uint256 public totalSupply;\n\n     /// @param _owner The address from which the balance will be retrieved\n     /// @return The balance\n     function balanceOf(address _owner) public constant returns (uint256 balance);\n\n     /// @notice send `_value` token to `_to` from `msg.sender`\n     /// @param _to The address of the recipient\n     /// @param _value The amount of token to be transferred\n     /// @return Whether the transfer was successful or not\n     function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);\n\n     /// @notice send `_value` token to `_to` from `_from` on the condition it is approved by `_from`\n     /// @param _from The address of the sender\n     /// @param _to The address of the recipient\n     /// @param _value The amount of token to be transferred\n     /// @return Whether the transfer was successful or not\n     function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);\n\n     /// @notice `msg.sender` approves `_spender` to spend `_value` tokens\n     /// @param _spender The address of the account able to transfer the tokens\n     /// @param _value The amount of tokens to be approved for transfer\n     /// @return Whether the approval was successful or not\n     function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);\n\n     /// @param _owner The address of the account owning tokens\n     /// @param _spender The address of the account able to transfer the tokens\n     /// @return Amount of remaining tokens allowed to spent\n     function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public constant returns (uint256 remaining);\n\n     event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value);\n     event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value);\n }\n\n library ECTools {\n\n     // @dev Recovers the address which has signed a message\n     // @thanks https://gist.github.com/axic/5b33912c6f61ae6fd96d6c4a47afde6d\n     function recoverSigner(bytes32 _hashedMsg, string _sig) public pure returns (address) {\n         require(_hashedMsg != 0x00);\n\n         // need this for test RPC\n         bytes memory prefix = \"\\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\\n32\";\n         bytes32 prefixedHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(prefix, _hashedMsg));\n\n         if (bytes(_sig).length != 132) {\n             return 0x0;\n         }\n         bytes32 r;\n         bytes32 s;\n         uint8 v;\n         bytes memory sig = hexstrToBytes(substring(_sig, 2, 132));\n         assembly {\n             r := mload(add(sig, 32))\n             s := mload(add(sig, 64))\n             v := byte(0, mload(add(sig, 96)))\n         }\n         if (v < 27) {\n             v += 27;\n         }\n         if (v < 27 || v > 28) {\n             return 0x0;\n         }\n         return ecrecover(prefixedHash, v, r, s);\n     }\n\n     // @dev Verifies if the message is signed by an address\n     function isSignedBy(bytes32 _hashedMsg, string _sig, address _addr) public pure returns (bool) {\n         require(_addr != 0x0);\n\n         return _addr == recoverSigner(_hashedMsg, _sig);\n     }\n\n     // @dev Converts an hexstring to bytes\n     function hexstrToBytes(string _hexstr) public pure returns (bytes) {\n         uint len = bytes(_hexstr).length;\n         require(len % 2 == 0);\n\n         bytes memory bstr = bytes(new string(len / 2));\n         uint k = 0;\n         string memory s;\n         string memory r;\n         for (uint i = 0;
