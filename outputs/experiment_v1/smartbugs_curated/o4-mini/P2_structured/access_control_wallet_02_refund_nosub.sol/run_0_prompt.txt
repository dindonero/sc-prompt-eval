You are a smart contract analyzer. You need to fully read the smart contracts code that I provide you later and understand and also carefully consider the inner logics of functions, explain the function call relationship, and the role of the call. There is no need to explain ERC20, ERC721, ERC777 function, and also function variable naming convention and other information. After that, you need to lead me to fully understand them.

Response requirements:
Divide the analysis into three parts. You are required to strictly follow the steps of first, second and third part to think step by step when giving responses.

In the first part: introduce the project background, what tasks the contracts are executing, and the goals they aim to achieve.

In the second part: identify the function locations by line number, the purpose of each function, and whether there are any call relationships. If there are, explain how the functions are called and the purpose of these calls.

In the third part: You should further audit the above file. Here are the DASP Top 10 vulnerability categories: {reentrancy, access_control, arithmetic, unchecked_low_level_calls, denial_of_service, bad_randomness, front_running, time_manipulation, short_addresses, other}. You need to combine the context and comprehensive analysis to detect whether there are the mentioned vulnerabilities in smart contracts. If it exists, answer 1. Otherwise, answer 0 such as {reentrancy: 1, ..., other: 0}. Moreover, you need to locate these vulnerabilities in smart contracts and show me the code snippets that have these vulnerabilities, such as {function withdraw {...}} and show the scope of vulnerabilities' influence {what functions and what lines of code are influenced}.

In the fourth part: After completing the analysis above, compile your findings into a JSON array for systematic processing:

```json
[
  {
    "category": "DASP category (reentrancy, access_control, arithmetic, etc.)",
    "title": "Brief vulnerability title",
    "evidence": {
      "file": "filename.sol",
      "lines": [line_numbers],
      "function": "functionName"
    },
    "explanation": "Detailed explanation of the vulnerability and how it could be exploited",
    "influence_scope": {
      "functions": ["list", "of", "affected", "functions"],
      "lines": [list, of, affected, lines]
    }
  }
]
```

Return [] if no vulnerabilities are found after completing the full analysis.

## CONTRACT TO AUDIT:
```solidity
/*
 
 * @author: -
 
 */

 pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

 /* User can add pay in and withdraw Ether.
    Unfortunately the developer forgot set the user's balance to 0 when refund() is called.
    An attacker can pay in a small amount of Ether and call refund() repeatedly to empty the contract.
 */

 contract Wallet {
     address creator;

     mapping(address => uint256) balances;

     constructor() public {
         creator = msg.sender;
     }

     function deposit() public payable {
         assert(balances[msg.sender] + msg.value > balances[msg.sender]);
         balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
     }

     function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
         require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);
         msg.sender.transfer(amount);
         balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
     }

     function refund() public {
         
         msg.sender.transfer(balances[msg.sender]);
     }

     // In an emergency the owner can migrate  allfunds to a different address.

     function migrateTo(address to) public {
         require(creator == msg.sender);
         to.transfer(this.balance);
     }

 }

```

Now perform the complete analysis. Think step by step through each part before providing your final JSON output.
