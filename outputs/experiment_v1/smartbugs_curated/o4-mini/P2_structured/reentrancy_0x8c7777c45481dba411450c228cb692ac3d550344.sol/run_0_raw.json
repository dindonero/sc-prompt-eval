You need to fully read the smart contracts code that I provide you later and understand and also carefully consider the inner logics of functions, explain the function call relationship, and the role of the call.

After that, you need to lead me to fully understand them.\n\nResponse requirements:\nDivide the analysis into three parts. You are required to strictly follow the steps of first, second and third part to think step by step when giving responses.\n\nIn the first part: introduce the project background, what tasks the contracts are executing, and the goals they aim to achieve.\n\nIn the second part: identify the function locations by line number, the purpose of each function, and whether there are any call relationships.
