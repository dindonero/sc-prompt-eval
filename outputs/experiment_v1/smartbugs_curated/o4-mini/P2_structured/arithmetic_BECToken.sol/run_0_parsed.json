I found two issues:\n\n1) arithmetic (unchecked multiplication overflow)  \n   \u2022 In `batchTransfer`, the line  \n     ```  \n     uint256 amount = uint256(cnt) * _value;  \n     ```  \n     does raw multiplication without SafeMath. Although `cnt <= 20`, a maliciously large `_value` could overflow on uint256.\n\n2) front_running (ERC-20 approve race condition)  \n   \u2022 The standard `approve` implementation allows resetting an allowance directly, opening the well-known \u201cdouble-spend\u201d / race condition if a spender front-runs an allowance change.\n\nAll other DASP categories appear false:  \nreentrancy: 0  \naccess_control: 0  \nunchecked_low_level_calls: 0  \ndenial_of_service: 0  \nbad_randomness: 0  \ntime_manipulation: 0  \nshort_addresses: 0  \nother: 0  \n\nPART 4 \u2013 JSON Output  \n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"category\": \"arithmetic\",\n    \"title\": \"Unchecked multiplication overflow in batchTransfer\",\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"file\": \"BecToken.sol\",\n      \"lines\": [182, 183],\n      \"function\": \"batchTransfer\"\n    },\n    \"explanation\": \"In batchTransfer, the code uses `uint256 amount = uint256(cnt) * _value;` without SafeMath.

    "rendered_prompt": "You are a smart contract analyzer. You need to fully read the smart contracts code that I provide you later and understand and also carefully consider the inner logics of functions, explain the function call relationship, and the role of the call. There is no need to explain ERC20, ERC721, ERC777 function, and also function variable naming convention and other information. After that, you need to lead me to fully understand them.\n\nResponse requirements:\nDivide the analysis into three parts. You are required to strictly follow the steps of first, second and third part to think step by step when giving responses.\n\nIn the first part: introduce the project background, what tasks the contracts are executing, and the goals they aim to achieve.\n\nIn the second part: identify the function locations by line number, the purpose of each function, and whether there are any call relationships. If there are, explain how the functions are called and the purpose of these calls.\n\nIn the third part: You should further audit the above file. Here are the DASP Top 10 vulnerability categories: {reentrancy, access_control, arithmetic, unchecked_low_level_calls, denial_of_service, bad_randomness, front_running, time_manipulation, short_addresses, other}. You need to combine the context and comprehensive analysis to detect whether there are the mentioned vulnerabilities in smart contracts. If it exists, answer 1. Otherwise, answer 0 such as {reentrancy: 1, ..., other: 0}. Moreover, you need to locate these vulnerabilities in smart contracts and show me the code snippets that have these vulnerabilities, such as {function withdraw {...}} and show the scope of vulnerabilities' influence {what functions and what lines of code are influenced}.\n\nIn the fourth part: After completing the analysis above, compile your findings into a JSON array for systematic processing:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"category\": \"DASP category (reentrancy, access_control, arithmetic, etc.)\",\n    \"title\": \"Brief vulnerability title\",\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"file\": \"filename.sol\",\n      \"lines\": [line_numbers],\n      \"function\": \"functionName\"\n    },\n    \"explanation\": \"Detailed explanation of the vulnerability and how it could be exploited\",\n    \"influence_scope\": {\n      \"functions\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"affected\", \"functions\"],\n      \"lines\": [list, of, affected, lines]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nReturn [] if no vulnerabilities are found after completing the full analysis.\n\n---\n\n## CONTRACT TO AUDIT:\n```solidity\n/*\n \n * @author: -\n \n */\n\npragma solidity ^0.4.16;\n\n/**\n * @title SafeMath\n * @dev Math operations with safety checks that throw on error\n */\nlibrary SafeMath {\n  function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal constant returns (uint256) {\n    uint256 c = a * b;\n    require(a == 0 || c / a == b);\n    return c;\n  }\n\n  function div(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal constant returns (uint256) {\n    // require(b > 0);
